	"llm_type_brief": "ChatGPT (version 3.0)",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly specifies examining ChatGPT-based error-detection exercises versus traditional error analysis on EFL descriptive writing and situates this within AI-in-education, error analysis, and cross-linguistic transfer literature.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, language_proficiency, learning_context, target_language, mother_tongue, age, and discipline together describe university freshmen, IELTS-based English proficiency, EFL academic writing context in Saudi Arabia, L2 English, Arabic L1, age 18–25, and course type, although sex is NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe convenience sampling of eight course sections of freshman EFL writers with homogeneous L1 Arabic and IELTS-based proficiency, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports group sizes and ANOVA results, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no explicit sample size justification or detailed representativeness discussion is provided.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization show that four sections in one semester were assigned to the control condition and four sections in a later semester to the ChatGPT condition without randomization, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence notes only demographic similarity (enrolled hours) but no baseline writing comparisons, leaving potential cohort and temporal biases.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "0",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints indicate a between-groups design with a single post-intervention descriptive essay written immediately after one error-analysis exercise and no pre-test or delayed follow-up, so time-based change in writing is not directly examined.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "1",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability report use of ETS TextEvaluator with corpus-based frequency and concreteness metrics and composite indices for syntactic complexity and cohesion, but Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training notes that no human raters were used and no sample-specific validity or reliability statistics or calibration against human ratings are provided.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation describe three weeks of prior instruction followed by a single 15-minute in-class error-detection exercise on a ChatGPT 3.0-generated essay or an instructor-generated essay and an immediate subsequent five-paragraph descriptive essay, while Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_model_configuration, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.llm_access_policy, Intervention.writing_stage, Intervention.writing_task_type, and Intervention.setting together provide sufficient procedural detail for approximate replication of the LLM-mediated activity.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "1",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method specifies one-way ANOVAs with Condition (ChatGPT vs control) as the between-subjects factor on the Outcome.primary_outcome_variables derived from ETS TextEvaluator, and Methodology.unit_of_analysis confirms individual essays as units, but the analysis does not account for the clustering of students within sections and semesters, so the match between design (section-based cohorts) and statistical model is only partial.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Outcome.effect_size_summary report F values, p values, and partial eta squared for significant differences in number of sentences and mean words per sentence, and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation describes use of TextEvaluator indices, but Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes that ANOVA assumptions such as normality and homogeneity of variance were not reported and no additional diagnostics are described.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis and Study Quality and Reporting.attrition_and_missing_data indicate exclusion of 29 students for non-completion or high plagiarism/AI-detection scores without further sensitivity analyses, while Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation provide a conceptual discussion linking modest ChatGPT-related gains to issues of academic integrity, agency, and cross-linguistic differences but with limited treatment of data-level anomalies.",
	"total_quality_score": "12",
	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Non-random section-by-semester assignment without a writing pre-test and exclusive reliance on automated TextEvaluator indices (no human rating reliability or ANOVA assumption diagnostics) limit causal inference about the impact of ChatGPT-based error analysis on writing quality.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "ChatGPT 3.0 was used only by the instructor to generate a single error-laden five-paragraph model essay for in-class error analysis while student essays were required to be non-AI and screened with plagiarism and AI-detection tools, and model access parameters or dates were not reported, constraining reproducibility and interpretation of LLM-related effects."
