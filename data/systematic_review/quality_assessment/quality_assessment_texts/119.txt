	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly specifies its comparative aims, identifies a gap around three-way feedback comparisons in EFL writing, and situates the work within feedback and hybrid intelligence frameworks.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, Participant Information.language_proficiency, Participant Information.learning_context, Participant Information.age, Participant Information.sex, and Participant Information.target_language provide clear information on learner level, proficiency, context, age range, and mixed-gender composition, although Participant Information.mother_tongue is NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe random selection of three intact classes from a single language center and acknowledge limited generalizability, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports total N and effect sizes, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no explicit sample size justification is provided.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "2",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method indicates cluster randomization of three intact IELTS writing classes to the feedback conditions, Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence reports no significant OPT proficiency differences across groups, and pre-test writing scores are controlled in ANCOVA, although cluster-level allocation procedures are not described in great detail.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a pre-test–post-test structure over a two-and-a-half-month semester (Intervention.duration) without delayed follow-up, so only short-term change between two timepoints is examined.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability document use of OPT and IELTS Writing Band Descriptors with anonymized double scoring and high inter-rater reliability (κw=0.85), and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training details blinded rating and consensus procedures, providing substantial evidence of reliability and validity for key measures.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration, Intervention.intervention_implementation, Intervention.writing_genre, Intervention.writing_stage, and Intervention.writing_task_type describe the semester structure and writing tasks, while LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.llm_access_policy, Intervention.llm_safety_guardrails) specify AI tools, prompt templates, training, and teacher roles in enough detail to broadly replicate the feedback conditions.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports ANOVA on OPT scores to check group homogeneity and ANCOVA for overall and component writing outcomes with pre-test scores as covariates, which aligns with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables, Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors, and Methodology.unit_of_analysis at the individual level, indicating appropriate matching of methods to the three-group pre-test–post-test design.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Outcome.effect_size_summary report F statistics, p-values, and partial η² for overall and component outcomes, but Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes that specific ANCOVA assumptions (e.g., normality of residuals, homogeneity of regression slopes) are not explicitly checked, and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation provides limited detail on diagnostic-driven data handling.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, while Outcome.limitation and Outcome.challenge discuss sampling, context, and feedback-integration constraints, and Outcome.implication interprets findings in light of feedback and hybrid intelligence perspectives referenced in Methodology.theoretical_foundation, indicating theoretical integration but no explicit outlier handling or sensitivity analyses.",
	"total_quality_score": "16",

	"key_quality_concerns": "Cluster-randomized intact classes from a single language center without power analysis or detailed ANCOVA assumption checks limit causal inference robustness and external validity.",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "ChatGPT-4 and related AI tools were integrated via rubric-aligned prompt templates within monitored AI-only and hybrid feedback routines, but specific LLM versions, access dates, and configuration parameters are not reported, which may constrain precise replication and cross-study comparability."
