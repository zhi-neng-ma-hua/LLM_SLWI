	"llm_type_brief": "ChatGPT-3.5",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims and Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, the study clearly states two aims about relationships between ChatGPT-based reflection, attendance, and final exam outcomes and positions these within an inquiry-based, SRL-oriented EFL writing context; Methodology.theoretical_foundation anchors the work in self-regulated learning and inquiry-based learning.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, Participant Information.discipline, and Participant Information.learning_context describe undergraduate EFL students in an English-medium Saudi university; Participant Information.language_proficiency, Participant Information.mother_tongue, Participant Information.sex, Participant Information.age, and Participant Information.target_language provide key language background and demographic details.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe convenience sampling of 95 female Arabic L1 students from a single English-medium university and explicitly note limited generalisability, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports N and correlation coefficients; however, Methodology.power_analysis is NR and there is no explicit justification of sample size adequacy.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method explains that students were not randomly assigned but self-selected into levels of engagement, and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization characterises this as a high-risk, non-randomised single-group design with potential confounding; Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence is NA because there is no control group, so allocation-related bias is acknowledged but not mitigated.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "0",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe four AI-assisted reflection activities across a 16-week course and a single final exam but do not include pre-test, post-test, or delayed post-test measures of writing or grammar performance, and Outcome.followup_length_and_type is NR/NA, so temporal change is not analysed as a longitudinal effect.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "0",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Outcome.writing_performance_measure describe essays, reflections, attendance, and final exam scores, but Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability reports only RAU transformation for normality without any reliability or validity evidence for the exam essay or grammar scoring, and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training notes that rubrics, rater training, and inter-rater reliability are not reported.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation provide a detailed 16-week cycle with four essay assignments, inquiry-based workshops, a fixed in-class ChatGPT-3.5 grammar-correction step, and reflection writing; Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_model_configuration, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.llm_access_policy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, and Intervention.setting collectively specify LLM use conditions and classroom roles sufficiently for approximate replication.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports RAU transformation of percentage scores followed by a paired-samples t-test comparing attendance and engagement measures and Pearson correlations between engagement/attendance and final exam essay and grammar scores, which align with the single-group correlational design in Methodology.research_design, the individual-level analysis unit in Methodology.unit_of_analysis, and the predictors and outcomes described in Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors and Outcome.primary_outcome_variables.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "2",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation state that percentage-based variables (engagement, attendance, exam scores) were converted to RAU to better satisfy normality assumptions before parametric tests; Outcome.statistical_significance provides t and r values with p-levels, and Outcome.effect_size_summary interprets correlation magnitudes, so both significance and effect-size information are available even though no additional formal assumption tests are reported.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, indicating no explicit handling of outliers or robustness checks; however, Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, and Outcome.implication link the correlational findings to self-regulated learning and inquiry-based theory from Methodology.theoretical_foundation and discuss contextual limitations such as sample restrictions, misuse of AI, and non-causal inferences.",
	"total_quality_score": "13",
	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Single-group correlational design with self-selected engagement and no pre–post or control comparison, together with absence of reported reliability or validity for exam essay and grammar scoring, limits causal inference and internal validity.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "No",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "ChatGPT-3.5 was used only via a fixed in-class grammar-correction prompt ('Correct my grammar.Highlight all changes') at the revision stage of four essay cycles, with AI otherwise prohibited and no details on access platform, version date, or model parameters, constraining reproducibility and focusing LLM effects narrowly on grammar feedback."
