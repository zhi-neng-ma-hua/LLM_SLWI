	"llm_type_brief": "ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims and Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, the study explicitly states its goals (examining ChatGPT-use patterns and pre–post changes in narrative writing) and situates them in a clear gap in AI-assisted L2 writing research, while Methodology.theoretical_foundation outlines genre- and AI-related frameworks supporting the design.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, .language_proficiency, .learning_context, .mother_tongue, .sex, .discipline, and .target_language together describe undergraduate status, TOEIC-based proficiency range, EFL university context, L1 (Korean), gender distribution, mixed majors, and L2 English, although exact age range is not reported.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "2",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness specify convenience sampling from one Korean university course (60 enrolled, 44 consenting), Methodology.power_analysis reports an a priori G*Power calculation, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect details N=44 with associated test statistics and effect sizes, while acknowledging limited representativeness.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization indicate a non-random single-group pre–post design in which all consenting students received the ChatGPT-assisted intervention, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence notes that only within-subject pre-test baselines were available, so potential selection and maturation biases are discussed but not controlled via group allocation.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a pre-test in week 1 and a post-test in week 15 within a 15-week intervention, but Outcome.followup_length_and_type is NA and no longer-term delayed follow-up beyond the course is reported, so temporal effects are limited to a single pre–post comparison.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument describes narrative pre/post tasks, an analytic narrative rubric, and automated syntactic tools (L2SCA, TAASSC), while Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training report normality checks, high inter-rater reliability for overall performance scores (r=.84) and prompt categorisation (Cohen Kappa=.80), and use of established syntactic analyzers, though internal consistency indices for the rubric itself are not reported.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation provide a week-by-week description of the 15-week course (film-based narrative tasks, three in-class ChatGPT-assisted revisions, pre/post tests), and LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, .llm_model_configuration, .llm_integration_mode, .prompting_strategy, .training_support_llm_literacy, .role_llm, .role_instructor, .llm_access_policy, .llm_safety_guardrails) specify ChatGPT-3.5 free web use, in-class supervised revision, prompt types, and ethical safeguards, enabling approximate replication.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports paired-sample t-tests for normally distributed pre–post fluency and syntactic indices, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-normal overall performance scores, and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, which align with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors (time as within-subject factor) and Methodology.unit_of_analysis (individual student texts).",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "2",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes normality checks via skewness, kurtosis, and Shapiro–Wilk with non-normal outcomes analysed using a non-parametric test, and Outcome.statistical_significance plus Outcome.effect_size_summary provide p-values and Cohen’s d for key comparisons with Bonferroni-adjusted alpha as described in Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, with no explicit procedures for identifying or handling outliers or conducting sensitivity analyses, but Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation offer a theoretically grounded interpretation of findings in relation to narrative genre, syntactic complexity, prompt literacy, and AI-assisted learning, while acknowledging design constraints such as lack of a control group and limits of automated complexity metrics.",
	"total_quality_score": "17",
	"quality_category": "High",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Single-group convenience sample from one course without a non-AI control group or long-term follow-up; no explicit outlier detection or sensitivity analyses reported.",

	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "Students used the free web version of ChatGPT-3.5 only during supervised in-class revision on their own sentences, which constrains unsupervised out-of-class use and may limit generalizability to other versions, prompt types, and writing contexts."
