	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method and Methodology.unit_of_analysis show that independent and paired samples t-tests were applied at the individual learner level to compare groups and pre–post scores on IELTS writing criteria, which aligns with the two-group pretest–posttest design and the Outcome.primary_outcome_variables and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors.",
