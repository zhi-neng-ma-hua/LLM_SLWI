	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly defines aims about pre–post writing performance with GPT-based chatbots within a process-based writing framework and situates this in a stated gap about their combined use for EFL writing.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, discipline, age, sex, learning_context, target_language, and language_proficiency describe 30 university EFL students aged 18–19 with more than ten years of English instruction in a Thai EFL context, although mother tongue and standardized proficiency scores are NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness report purposive sampling of 30 students from a single 'Approaches to Writing' course at a provincial university with limited generalizability, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect provides N and key test statistics, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no formal sample size or power justification is given.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "0",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method is NA and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization notes that only a single group received the intervention with no randomization or control group, while Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence is NaN, so group allocation bias and design-related confounding are inherent and not addressed beyond general limitations.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "2",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a 10-session single-group pretest–posttest design with four in-course writing quizzes and analyses of change over time using paired-samples t-tests and repeated-measures ANOVA, although Outcome.followup_length_and_type is NaN and no longer-term follow-up beyond the immediate post-test is reported.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability detail a researcher-designed analytic writing rubric with five components reviewed and adjusted by two English lecturers, and inter-rater reliability coefficients of .87 and .84 on sample compositions, while Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training describes experienced raters applying standardized criteria across pre-test, post-test, and quizzes for this L2 writing cohort.",

	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation outline a 10-session sequence (pre-test, two sessions of modeling, four GPT-supported quiz cycles, and post-test) with explicit descriptions of how GPT-based chatbots were integrated into pre-writing, drafting, revising, and editing stages, and Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.writing_stage, and Intervention.setting further specify roles, tasks, and context despite lacking technical model version details.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports descriptive statistics, paired-samples t-tests for pre–post comparisons, and repeated-measures ANOVA with sphericity corrections for four quiz scores, which aligns with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors that treat time and quiz as within-subject factors and with Methodology.unit_of_analysis using individual student writing scores.",

	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation indicate direct analysis of rubric-based scores with reported t, F, and p values, and Outcome.effect_size_summary notes a large partial eta squared (≈0.781) for the quiz factor, while Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics mentions sphericity corrections (Greenhouse–Geisser and Huynh–Feldt) for repeated-measures ANOVA even though other diagnostics such as normality tests are not detailed.",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "Students directly used unspecified GPT-based chatbots as real-time collaborators throughout process-based writing stages, but the exact product/version, platform, safety guardrails, and systematic LLM literacy training were not reported, constraining reproducibility and interpretation of the AI component."
