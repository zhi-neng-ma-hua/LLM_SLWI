	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a pre-test post-test design over an eight week Intervention.duration, but Outcome.followup_length_and_type states that no delayed or follow-up tests were conducted and time-related effects are only examined via immediate pre post comparisons.",

	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability describe curriculum-aligned tests and a TAM-based questionnaire adapted from prior work, but no reliability indices are reported and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training is largely NR regarding rater training and scoring consistency.",

	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation give a detailed staged description of ClipTalk activities across eight weeks, including writing_stage, setting, teacher role (Intervention.role_instructor), LLM role and integration (Intervention.llm_model_type, llm_integration_mode, prompting_strategy, training_support_llm_literacy), even though llm_model_configuration and llm_safety_guardrails are NR.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "1",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports independent samples t tests for group comparisons and Pearson correlations for behavioral indicators with outcomes, aligned with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors and Methodology.unit_of_analysis at the individual level, but the design involves intact classes and a pre-test post-test structure without analytic adjustment for clustering or explicit modeling of group by time effects.",
