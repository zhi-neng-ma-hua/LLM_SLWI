	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Basic Identification.research_aims clearly states the goal of evaluating CHAT-OAI-supported project-based professional learning versus traditional writing and examining motivational perceptions, and Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty highlights limited evidence on LLM-supported professional writing, but Methodology.theoretical_foundation notes only an implicit orientation to technology-assisted and project-based learning without an explicit formal framework.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "1",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, discipline, learning_context and target_language identify university English language learners in India, but Participant Information.language_proficiency, mother_tongue, sex and age are all NR, so key language background and demographic variables are missing.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect report a convenience sample of 77 university students with paired pre- and post-test scores, and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness acknowledges the single-institution context without broader claims, while Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no formal sample size or power justification is given.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization describe a single treatment cohort with no separate control group and no random assignment to conditions, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence indicates that between-group equivalence is not applicable, so selection and confounding biases remain a concern.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a single-group pre-test–post-test design with one pre-recorded and one post-recorded test around the CHAT-OAI intervention, and Outcome.followup_length_and_type states that no delayed follow-up assessments were conducted.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "0",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument indicates that in-house pre-recorded and post-recorded tests were used along with open-ended questions, but Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training are NR, with no information on test validity, reliability or scoring/rater procedures.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "1",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.experimental_group_intervention and Intervention.intervention_implementation outline a sequence from traditional teaching to CHAT-OAI-supported blended project-based activities with professional writing genres specified in Intervention.writing_genre and Intervention.writing_task_type, yet Intervention.duration, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy and Intervention.llm_safety_guardrails are NR or unclear, limiting replicability of timing and LLM use details.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports use of Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk tests followed by a Wilcoxon signed-rank test and effect size r for paired pre- and post-test scores, which aligns with the non-normal data, single-group pre–post structure and Outcome.primary_outcome_variables at the individual level specified in Methodology.unit_of_analysis.",

	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes that normality was tested with KS and SW and that non-normality led to a nonparametric Wilcoxon test, Outcome.statistical_significance presents the z and p values, and Outcome.effect_size_summary reports an r≈0.55 effect size, while Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation indicates no additional preprocessing or transformation.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis states that outliers were mentioned but no specific treatment or sensitivity analyses were conducted, and although Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge and Outcome.implication discuss design limitations, potential overreliance on AI and broader pedagogical implications in light of Methodology.theoretical_foundation, this integration remains relatively general.",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "ChatGPT (CHAT-OAI) was used as a quick-response generator in a single-group blended project-based professional writing course, but the study did not report the model version, interaction mode, prompting strategy, usage policies or safety guardrails, limiting reproducibility and interpretation of the LLM-supported learning gains."
