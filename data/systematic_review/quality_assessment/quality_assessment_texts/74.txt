	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "1",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Basic Identification.research_aims clearly states that the study examines GenAI chatbot effects on EFL listening and writing and explores learner perceptions, and Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty highlights the lack of prior experimental GenAI work especially on L2 listening, but Methodology.theoretical_foundation is NR so no explicit theoretical framework is articulated.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, language_proficiency, learning_context, target_language, age, sex and discipline describe 93 undergraduate non-English majors aged 18–23 in mandatory EFL courses at a public university with approximately B1 proficiency, although Participant Information.mother_tongue is NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness report purposeful sampling of students in mandatory EFL classes at one public university, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect details initial consent N=121, final N=93 and group sizes, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no formal sample size or power justification is provided.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "2",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization state that participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=48) and a comparison group (n=45) after sampling, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence reports no significant pre-test differences in listening or writing scores between groups.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "2",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Intervention.duration describe a quasi-experimental pretest–posttest–follow-up design over a 10-week intervention with additional follow-up months later, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints and Outcome.followup_length_and_type specify listening and writing assessments at pre-test, immediate post-test and delayed follow-up, with time and group×time effects analyzed via repeated-measures ANOVA.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "1",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability indicate that listening cloze tests and TOEFL iBT academic discussion rubric scores were used, scored by two external PhD-level English teachers with percentage agreement above 80% and piloted procedures, but Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training does not provide detailed rater training information or numerical reliability coefficients beyond agreement percentages.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation outline ten weekly Gemini- and ChatGPT-mediated activities alongside regular EFL classes, Intervention.writing_stage and Intervention.writing_task_type specify the listening cloze and argumentative writing tasks and assessment structure, and LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, llm_model_configuration, llm_integration_mode, prompting_strategy, role_llm, role_instructor, llm_access_policy, training_support_llm_literacy) together describe student, teacher and LLM roles in sufficient procedural detail despite limited information on explicit llm_safety_guardrails.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports using repeated-measures ANOVA with group and time factors followed by Holm-adjusted paired and unpaired t-tests on individual students’ listening and writing scores (Methodology.unit_of_analysis), which is consistent with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors describing a group×time structure for both outcomes.",

	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes that normality, sphericity and homogeneity of variances were checked via Q-Q plots, Mauchly’s test and Levene’s test and were not violated, Outcome.statistical_significance reports F, t and p values for main and interaction effects, and Outcome.effect_size_summary provides η² effect sizes for time, group and group×time effects, while Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation is NR regarding further transformations.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR and no sensitivity analyses are described, but Outcome.limitation and Outcome.challenge discuss design limitations, attrition-related issues and implementation challenges, and Outcome.implication interprets short-term gains and reduced follow-up effects in relation to GenAI-assisted learning despite Methodology.theoretical_foundation being NR.",
	"total_quality_score": "16",
	"quality_category": "High",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Purposeful single-university sample with substantial attrition and no power analysis, plus no reported outlier or sensitivity analyses despite a multi-time-point randomized comparison design.",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "Gemini and a ChatGPT-powered Telegram bot were used for required weekly activities in the experimental group while the comparison group had optional unmonitored chatbot use, and exact LLM model versions and parameters were not reported, which complicates isolating and reproducing the GenAI effects."
