	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly specifies multiple aims (usage patterns, performance effects, and perceptions by proficiency level) and situates them within social constructivism, Flower and Hayes’ writing model, Jacobs’ rubric, and the Technology Acceptance Model.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information fields report educational_level (11th-grade high school students), language_proficiency (higher-level vs lower-level groups defined by IELTS writing scores), learning_context (EFL high school in Hanoi), target_language (English), age (16 years), and discipline (general secondary education), with prior_experience_llm noted as none and mother_tongue and sex coded as NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe convenience sampling of 47 11th-grade students from one high school in Hanoi and acknowledge limited generalizability, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports group sizes and key test statistics, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no explicit sample-size justification is provided.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "2",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method explains that students were non-randomly categorized into higher-level and lower-level groups based on IELTS writing pretest scores, and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization notes the absence of randomization and a non-AI control group and highlights the resulting selection bias; Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence clarifies that groups were intentionally nonequivalent in proficiency.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Outcome.assessment_timepoints show a pretest in week 1, ongoing chatbot-supported writing during weeks 2–9, a posttest and questionnaire in week 10, and interviews in week 11, indicating a short-term pre–post design without any delayed follow-up as confirmed in Outcome.followup_length_and_type.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument describes established tools (IELTS Task 2 prompts, Jacobs’ writing rubric, TAM-based questionnaire, chat logs), while Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training report high inter-rater reliability for chat coding (Cohen’s kappa=0.93) and writing scores (kappa=0.83 and 0.87) plus strong internal consistency for the questionnaire (Cronbach’s alpha=0.92), supporting reliability and validity for the EFL writing context.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation detail an 11-week timeline with specific weekly activities (pretest/orientation, eight weeks of WAB-supported home essays, posttest, questionnaire, interviews), while Intervention.writing_stage, Intervention.writing_task_type, Intervention.setting, and LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_model_configuration, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.llm_access_policy, Intervention.llm_safety_guardrails) collectively provide sufficient information to replicate the chatbot-based writing practice.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports using Shapiro–Wilk tests followed by non-parametric Mann–Whitney U tests for between-group comparisons and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for within-group pre–post writing scores, which is appropriate for the small sample and non-normal distributions described, and these methods align with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables, Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors, and Methodology.unit_of_analysis (individual learners).",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes the use of Shapiro–Wilk tests and a rationale for choosing non-parametric tests, and Outcome.statistical_significance and Methodology.data_analysis_method provide z-values, U-values, and p-values along with some non-parametric r effect sizes for Mann–Whitney tests in Outcome.effect_size_summary, but effect sizes for the main Wilcoxon pre–post writing outcomes and more detailed diagnostics or data transformations (Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation) are not reported.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, indicating no explicit procedures for outlier handling or sensitivity checks, whereas Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation show that findings are interpreted within social constructivist and writing-process frameworks and that methodological limitations (small single-site sample, no control group) are discussed, but without specific treatment of anomalous data patterns.",
	"total_quality_score": "16",
	"quality_category": "High",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "All students used an unsupervised home-based WAB built on GPT-3.5 Turbo with limited reporting of underlying prompts, API configuration, or technical safety features, which may affect both adherence monitoring and the reproducibility of chatbot behavior across replications."
