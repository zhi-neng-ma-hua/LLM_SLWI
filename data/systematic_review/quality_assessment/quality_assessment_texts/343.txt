	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly specifies comparisons between AI-enabled cognitive offload instruction and traditional instruction, examines essay quality and mediation by cognitive offloading, and situates these aims within articulated gaps and critical thinking, cognitive offloading and extended mind frameworks.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "1",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, Participant Information.discipline, Participant Information.language_proficiency, Participant Information.learning_context and Participant Information.target_language indicate first-year English majors in Thai universities with CEFR B2-level L2 English, but Participant Information.age, Participant Information.sex and Participant Information.mother_tongue are NR, so key demographic information is incomplete.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "2",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe convenience sampling of four colleges with intact classes assigned to AI offload or control conditions, Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports N=240 with detailed effects, and Methodology.power_analysis notes that sample size targets were informed by quasi-experimental norms for detecting medium effects, while acknowledging the absence of a formal a priori power calculation.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "2",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization explain that intact classes within four colleges were assigned to AI enabled cognitive offload versus traditional control in a nonequivalent groups quasi-experimental design, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence reports similar pretest critical thinking means with ANCOVA using pretest as a covariate, while explicitly noting potential selection and cluster biases.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "2",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Intervention.duration describe a 12-week semester-long pretest–posttest nonequivalent groups design, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints and Outcome.followup_length_and_type indicate critical thinking and essay data at week 1 and week 12 with analyses of gains over time, although no delayed follow-up beyond the intervention is reported.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability report a validated L2-appropriate Watson–Glaser critical thinking test (Cronbach’s alpha≈0.89), an essay quality rubric with three blind raters (inter-rater alpha≈0.92), and a Cognitive Offloading Scale with Cronbach’s alpha≈0.90 and CFA indices (CFI≈0.95, RMSEA≈0.04), while Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training notes blind rating of essays, though detailed rater training procedures are not fully described.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation provide a structured description of the 12-week four-phase cycle (AI brainstorming, individual analysis, peer AI co-revision, reflective journaling) for the intervention group and a parallel non-AI cycle for the control group, and LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_model_configuration, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.llm_access_policy, Intervention.setting) specify ChatGPT’s role, scaffolds, and instructional context, although technical safety guardrails and exact model configuration are NR.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method describes ANCOVA with pretest as a covariate for critical thinking, independent samples t tests for essay quality metrics, and mediation analysis using Hayes’ PROCESS with bootstrapping, which aligns with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables, Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors and Methodology.unit_of_analysis that treat individual students and essays as units with group condition and cognitive offloading as predictors.",

	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes that ANCOVA assumptions including normality, homogeneity and linearity were checked via residual plots and Levene’s test, Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation describes anonymisation and index computation, and Outcome.statistical_significance together with Outcome.effect_size_summary report F and t statistics, p-values, partial eta squared, Cohen’s d and indirect effects from mediation, indicating explicit reporting of significance and effect sizes.",

	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR and no sensitivity analyses are reported, but Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge and Outcome.implication, together with Methodology.theoretical_foundation, discuss limits of the nonequivalent groups design, contextual generalisability and theoretical implications for cognitive offloading, extended mind and L2 writing pedagogy, demonstrating integrative interpretation without explicit treatment of outliers.",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "ChatGPT is used as a structured cognitive offloading tool for brainstorming and lower-order drafting within a 12-week AI-enabled writing cycle, but the specific model version, access mode, parameter settings and technical safety guardrails are not reported, which limits precise replication and cross-LLM comparability."
