	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims and Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, the study clearly focuses on ChatGPT-powered NPCs in storyline-driven game-based EFL writing, specifies targeted outcomes (motivation, cognitive factors, writing performance, interaction patterns), and is framed within CAMIL and related theories in Methodology.theoretical_foundation.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, language_proficiency, learning_context, age, sex, discipline and target_language together describe Chinese undergraduate EFL students at CEFR B2–C1 in a university writing course, with clear demographic and contextual information though mother_tongue is marked NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.group_assignment_method report non-random intact class sampling of two undergraduate classes with total N=85 detailed in Methodology.sample_size_and_effect, and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness notes single-site and genre-related limits to generalisability, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no explicit sample size rationale is provided.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization describe a quasi-experimental design with two intact classes assigned to experimental and control conditions, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence notes use of baseline intrinsic motivation as an ANCOVA covariate but lacks broader baseline writing measures or full bias analysis, so potential selection bias remains.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration and Outcome.assessment_timepoints indicate a single 85-minute session with pre- and post-measures for intrinsic motivation and only immediate post measures for situational interest, cognitive factors and writing, with Outcome.followup_length_and_type as NA, so short-term change is captured but no longer-term effects are examined.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability report use of adapted, previously validated questionnaires (IMI, SIS, CLS, MSLQ) with Cronbach’s alpha values mostly above .73, good Weighted Kappa (> .60) for the writing rubric on a subset of essays, and high inter-coder agreement (>95%) for chat move coding, with scoring procedures and rater agreement described in Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation detail the timing and steps of the 85-minute session, while Intervention.writing_stage, writing_task_type and setting describe the writing task, and LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, llm_model_configuration, llm_integration_mode, prompting_strategy, training_support_llm_literacy, role_llm, role_instructor, llm_access_policy, llm_safety_guardrails) provide specific information about ChatGPT-powered NPC setup and use that would support replication.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method outlines logistic regression for dropout checks, ANCOVA with pre intrinsic motivation as covariate for motivation outcomes, independent-samples t tests for situational interest, cognitive factors and writing performance, and Cohen’s d for effect sizes, which aligns with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables, Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors and the individual-level unit in Methodology.unit_of_analysis for this two-group quasi-experimental design.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "2",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes checks of skewness, kurtosis and homogeneity of regression slopes for ANCOVA, while Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation describes straightforward scoring and coding procedures without complex transformations, and Outcome.statistical_significance together with Outcome.effect_size_summary report F and t statistics, p values, partial eta squared and Cohen’s d for key outcomes.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, yet Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge and Outcome.implication discuss design limits (single site, short duration, narrative type), implementation challenges and theoretical implications within the CAMIL and immersive learning perspectives described in Methodology.theoretical_foundation, indicating some integrative interpretation but no explicit handling of outliers or robustness checks.",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) powered NPCs were implemented via Poe using prompt-engineered character roles and constrained knowledge bases within one 85-minute session, but full system prompts, model parameters and any out-of-class LLM use were not reported, which may limit reproducibility and interpretation of effects."
