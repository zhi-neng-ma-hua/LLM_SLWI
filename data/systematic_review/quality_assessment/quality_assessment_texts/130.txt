	"llm_type_brief": "ChatGPT (GPT-series; version not reported)",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly states its dual aims (CT-oriented writing performance and ChatGPT acceptance) and situates them in a CT-infused EFL writing and UTAUT2 framework, addressing a specific gap in GPT-based CT-oriented writing research.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, language_proficiency, learning_context, target_language, sex and discipline specify first-year undergraduate EFL learners at three public universities, with CEFR B2 proficiency, mixed majors and a reported gender distribution, while only age and mother_tongue are NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "2",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe convenience and purposive sampling of 250 first-year undergraduates from three universities in one province with acknowledged limits to generalisability, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect plus Methodology.power_analysis explain that sample size followed recommended item-to-respondent ratios for the questionnaire even though no formal power analysis was conducted.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization indicate a single non-randomised intervention group with no control group, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence notes that between-group equivalence is not applicable, so allocation and its limitations are described but substantial risk of bias remains.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration and Outcome.assessment_timepoints report a single-group pretest–posttest design over eight weeks (pre-test, six CT-oriented ChatGPT-supported lessons, immediate post-test), while Outcome.followup_length_and_type is NR and Outcome.limitation acknowledges the absence of delayed follow-up.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "1",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability provide strong reliability and validity evidence for the ChatGPT acceptance questionnaire (Cronbach’s alpha, KMO, Bartlett’s test, pretesting), and describe the CT-oriented rubric for writing, but Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training notes only that two lecturers scored essays independently without reporting rater training procedures or inter-rater reliability coefficients.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation outline an eight-week, six-lesson CT-infused writing sequence with four clearly defined stages per lesson (brainstorming with ChatGPT, drafting, AI-assisted peer review, revision), and Intervention.writing_stage, setting, llm_model_type, llm_model_configuration, llm_integration_mode, prompting_strategy, training_support_llm_literacy, role_llm, role_instructor and llm_access_policy together give sufficient detail on ChatGPT’s role, structured CT-based prompts and classroom implementation to enable approximate replication despite missing technical model-version details.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method describes the use of descriptive statistics and paired t-tests for pre–post comparisons of CT-oriented writing scores and UTAUT2 constructs, which aligns with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables, Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors and Methodology.unit_of_analysis that define time (pre vs post) as the main factor and individual students’ writing and acceptance scores as dependent measures.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect report paired t-test results and Cohen’s d effect sizes for several ChatGPT acceptance constructs, but Outcome.effect_size_summary notes that effect sizes for CT-oriented writing gains are not reported and Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics plus Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation indicate no explicit checks or discussion of t-test assumptions or outlier handling.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, with no described procedures for detecting or addressing unusual data, while Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge and Outcome.implication, together with Methodology.theoretical_foundation, provide a theoretically grounded discussion of design limitations, risks of overreliance and cheating, and the positioning of ChatGPT as a CT-oriented scaffold.",
	"total_quality_score": "15",
	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Single-group pretest–posttest design without a control group, absence of reported inter-rater reliability for CT-oriented writing scores, and lack of assumption or outlier checks reduce causal interpretability and statistical robustness.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "All students used free ChatGPT accounts with highly structured CT-based prompts for brainstorming and peer review, but the specific model version, configuration details and actual usage logs were not reported, which constrains reproducibility and precise estimation of LLM exposure."
