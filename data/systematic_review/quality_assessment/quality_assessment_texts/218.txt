	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly states GenAI-CT aims for AI-supported critical-thinking development in EFL writing, identifies gaps in scaffold design and process tracing, and grounds the intervention in established CT and sociocultural frameworks.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, Participant Information.language_proficiency, Participant Information.learning_context, Participant Information.discipline, Participant Information.sex, Participant Information.age, and Participant Information.target_language provide detailed information on year level, CEFR-based proficiency, vocational majors, EFL context, gender distribution, age, and L2, although Participant Information.mother_tongue is NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method, Methodology.sample_size_and_effect, and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe purposive sampling of 92 students across three colleges and acknowledge limited generalizability, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no formal sample size justification beyond feasibility is reported.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization indicate that all students received the same GenAI-CT intervention via purposive sampling with no control group or random assignment, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence notes only general low baseline CT levels, so potential selection and history biases are not fully addressed.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints show a pre–post design over four action research cycles with baseline and post-intervention critical-thinking writing tasks, but Outcome.followup_length_and_type is NR and no delayed follow-up assessment was conducted.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "1",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability describe rubric-based CT writing tasks, NVivo-supported qualitative coding, member checking, and peer debriefing, yet Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training does not report the number of raters, rater training, or inter-rater reliability statistics, and no reliability indices for the CT rubric or survey are provided.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration, Intervention.intervention_implementation, Intervention.writing_stage, Intervention.setting, and LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.llm_access_policy) give a detailed account of the four GenAI-CT cycles, AI tools used (ChatGPT, GPT-4-based assistant, Writesonic, Grammarly), structured prompts, and teacher and student roles, supporting general replicability of the intervention.",

	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method, Outcome.primary_outcome_variables, Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors, and Methodology.unit_of_analysis show that pre–post CT rubric scores at the individual-student level were analyzed with paired t-tests and ANCOVA using pretest scores as covariates and college as a factor, which is broadly consistent with the single-group, multiple-case action research design.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Outcome.effect_size_summary report t-values, p-values, and large Cohen’s d effect sizes for CT gains, and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation notes direct use of rubric scores, but Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics indicates no explicit checks of normality, variance homogeneity, or ANCOVA assumptions.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR and there is no description of outlier handling or sensitivity analyses, although Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation together indicate some integration of findings with the GenAI-CT theoretical framework and acknowledgement of design constraints such as the absence of a non-AI control group.",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "Multi-tool generative AI (ChatGPT/GPT-4-based assistant, Writesonic, Grammarly) was integrated via structured GenAI-CT prompts and iterative cycles, but specific model versions, parameter settings, and complete prompt sets were not reported, limiting precise reproducibility of LLM behavior."
