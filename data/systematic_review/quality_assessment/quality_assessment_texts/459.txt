	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly formulates aims about AI effects at pre-writing, drafting, and post-writing stages, identifies a specific gap in stage-wise evidence in Arab EFL contexts, and anchors the work in writing process and cognitive load theory.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "1",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, Participant Information.discipline, Participant Information.learning_context, Participant Information.language_proficiency, and Participant Information.target_language specify first-year English-major undergraduates in an EFL context with admission-based proficiency, but Participant Information.age, Participant Information.sex, and Participant Information.mother_tongue are NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe a random sample of EL117 students from a single faculty, randomly divided into experimental and control groups, with acknowledged limits to generalizability, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports N=47 with detailed pre/post means and effect sizes, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no a priori sample-size justification is given.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "2",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Methodology.sampling_method state that students were randomly divided into experimental and control groups, Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization notes random division albeit without procedural detail, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence reports no significant pre-test difference between groups, supporting baseline comparability.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Intervention.duration describe a pre-test/post-test design over 10 weekly sessions, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints specifies pre-test before and post-test after the intervention, but there is no delayed follow-up or analysis of longer-term effects, so only short-term change is captured.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "1",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument details a three-stage essay test and an analytic rubric adapted from established sources, and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability plus Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training note use of independent raters and normality checks, but no quantitative indices of inter-rater reliability or rubric validity (e.g., kappa, alpha) are reported.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation outline 10 two-hour tutorials across four rhetorical patterns with explicit sequencing of activities, while Intervention.writing_stage, Intervention.writing_task_type, Intervention.setting, Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.control_group_intervention, Intervention.experimental_group_intervention, and Intervention.llm_access_policy jointly provide sufficient detail on how ChatGPT-3 was used at each writing stage to enable approximate replication despite NR for Intervention.llm_safety_guardrails and limited technical configuration detail.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "1",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports use of normality tests followed by t-tests to compare experimental and control groups at pre-test and post-test and at each writing stage, which broadly aligns with the two-group pre/post design and Outcome.primary_outcome_variables and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors, but the analyses do not model the full group × time structure (e.g., via repeated-measures ANOVA or ANCOVA) and thus only partially exploit the repeated-measures aspect described in Methodology.unit_of_analysis.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "2",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics indicates that Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk tests confirmed normality for pre- and post-test scores, Outcome.statistical_significance reports t-values and p-values for group comparisons, Outcome.effect_size_summary provides Cohen’s d for overall and stage-specific differences, and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation notes that raw rubric scores were used without additional transformations.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, but Outcome.limitation and Outcome.challenge discuss constraints such as small single-institution sample, composite treatment of the post-writing stage, and risks of overreliance on AI, and Outcome.implication together with Methodology.theoretical_foundation interprets findings through writing process and cognitive load theory, integrating results with theoretical and methodological considerations without addressing data outliers or robustness checks.",
	"total_quality_score": "14",
	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Small single-institution sample with limited reporting on rater reliability and no blinding, combined with simple t-test analyses that do not fully model group × time effects, constrain the robustness and generalizability of conclusions about AI impacts at different writing stages.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "ChatGPT-3 was integrated across pre-writing, drafting, and post-writing as a generative assistant for outlines, full essays, and editing, but the study does not report model version, technical configuration, safety guardrails, or detailed prompt wording, and allows AI to paraphrase and restructure whole essays, which complicates reproducibility and attribution of gains to learners’ own writing processes."
