	"llm_type_brief": "Meta AI (WhatsApp) & ChatGPT 4.0",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly states its aims (comparing AI-driven vs non-AI feedback on ESL writing accuracy) within an interactionist and sociocultural framework and identifies a specific gap regarding Meta AI–enabled WhatsApp feedback for grammatical error reduction.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information fields report educational level (undergraduates), discipline (non-English majors), age range (20–23 years), learning context (ESL), target language (English L2), and mother tongue (Hindi), although detailed proficiency levels are not specified beyond ESL status.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe random selection from two existing English-speaking classes and random assignment to two groups (N=56 each) with noted limits on generalizability, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports group sizes and RM-ANOVA effects, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no explicit sample size justification is provided.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization state that learners were randomly assigned to AI-driven and non-AI-driven feedback groups, but Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence indicates only that pretest conditions were identical and descriptive scores were similar, without statistical tests or detailed baseline bias discussion.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "2",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Intervention.duration describe a 20-week pretest–posttest design with repeated writing and feedback cycles, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints notes pretest at the start and posttest at the end, with RM-ANOVA examining main effects of time and the group-by-time interaction; no delayed follow-up is reported.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "0",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability state that ChatGPT 4.0 was used to detect and score ten grammatical error types in writing tasks, but no reliability coefficients, validity evidence, or checks on the consistency or accuracy of AI scoring are reported, and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training does not describe any human rating or calibration.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation detail a 20-week schedule with three writing tasks per week, identical task conditions for both groups, and distinct feedback cycles, while LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_model_configuration, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.llm_access_policy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.setting) together describe how Meta AI within WhatsApp and ChatGPT 4.0 were used, making the procedure broadly replicable despite missing precise model parameters.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports the use of two-way repeated measures ANOVA with group (AI vs non-AI) as a between-subjects factor and assessment time (pre vs post) as a within-subjects factor, which matches Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors and the pretest–posttest design, and Methodology.unit_of_analysis confirms that analysis was conducted at the individual learner writing score level.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Outcome.effect_size_summary provide RM-ANOVA F values, p values, and partial eta squared for group, time, and interaction effects, but Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes that no specific checks for RM-ANOVA assumptions (for example, normality or sphericity) are reported, and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation describes only basic text processing and AI scoring without assumption-focused diagnostics.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, indicating no reported handling of outliers or sensitivity analyses, but Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation link the findings to interactionist and sociocultural perspectives and discuss constraints related to WhatsApp-based AI feedback, participant demographics, and context, providing some theoretical and methodological integration.",
	"total_quality_score": "14",
	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Automated ChatGPT 4.0 scoring of writing with no reported reliability or validity evidence and absence of outlier or RM-ANOVA assumption diagnostics, combined with a single-sample of two Hindi-speaking undergraduate classes, limit the robustness and generalizability of the findings.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "Learners received AI-driven corrective feedback from Meta AI in WhatsApp while writing scores and error analyses were generated by ChatGPT 4.0, but specific model versions, prompts, configuration parameters, safety guardrails, and scoring validation were not reported, constraining reproducibility and interpretation of AI-related effects."
