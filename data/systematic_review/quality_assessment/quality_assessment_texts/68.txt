	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly states its aim to compare three proofreading interventions, identifies specific gaps in automated writing evaluation research, and situates the work within an AWE-oriented framework linked to Korean secondary education goals.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, language_proficiency, learning_context, target_language, mother_tongue, age, sex, and discipline together provide detailed information on 16-year-old Korean B1 EFL high school students learning English writing in a public school context.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect describe convenience sampling of 79 learners from one public high school and the number of texts analyzed, while Methodology.power_analysis is NR and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness notes that no broader statistical representativeness beyond the single-school context was claimed.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "2",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization explain that learners within pre-designated classes were randomly assigned to three counterbalanced sequence groups experiencing all three conditions, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence notes that classical between-group baseline comparisons were not applicable in this within-subjects design, although Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_blinding indicates that rater blinding to condition was not reported.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "0",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Outcome.assessment_timepoints indicate a counterbalanced repeated-measures comparison of three proofreading conditions across separate tasks, but Outcome.followup_length_and_type states that there was no pre–post change analysis or delayed follow-up, with outcomes limited to immediate product-level texts.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability describe the adapted TOEFL iBT rubric, CohMetrix indices, and a detailed error taxonomy with high inter-rater reliability for holistic scores and error coding, and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training reports rater calibration, double scoring, and use of mean ratings appropriate for L2 writing assessment.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration, Intervention.intervention_implementation, Intervention.writing_genre, Intervention.writing_stage, and Intervention.writing_task_type specify the timing, topics, and structure of the three guided argumentative writing sessions, while Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.llm_model_configuration, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.llm_access_policy, and Intervention.setting detail how ChatGPT and machine translation were integrated at the revision stage, providing sufficient information to broadly replicate the procedures despite unspecified model versions and llm_safety_guardrails being NR.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method and Methodology.unit_of_analysis indicate that repeated-measures one-way ANOVAs with Bonferroni corrections were applied at the per-student-per-condition level to compare SP, MAP, and CAP on Outcome.primary_outcome_variables given the within-subjects proofreading condition factor described in Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors, which is consistent with the design and continuous outcome measures.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Methodology.data_analysis_method report F and p values from repeated-measures ANOVAs with Bonferroni adjustments, but Outcome.effect_size_summary notes that standardized effect sizes were not provided and Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation do not describe checks of normality, sphericity, or other model assumptions beyond basic preprocessing.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, while Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation document methodological limitations, AI-related risks, and pedagogical implications within an automated writing evaluation perspective but without explicit handling of outliers or sensitivity analyses.",
	"total_quality_score": "15",
	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Convenience sampling from a single high school without power analysis and a short-term, product-only repeated-measures design, combined with limited reporting on blinding, assumption checks, and outlier handling for the ANOVA analyses.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "Students directly used ChatGPT on mobile devices with scripted translation and proofreading prompts during in-class revision, but the specific ChatGPT version, detailed prompt variants, and any safety or configuration settings were not reported, limiting precise replication and interpretation of the LLM component."
