	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly states its aims (revision, transfer, and affective outcomes), articulates a specific gap in randomized evidence on LLM feedback in secondary EFL writing, and is grounded in multiple feedback and motivation theories.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, Participant Information.age, Participant Information.sex, Participant Information.learning_context, Participant Information.target_language, Participant Information.discipline, and Participant Information.language_proficiency provide detailed information on grade level, age, gender distribution, EFL context, L2, course type, and general proficiency, although mother tongue is NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe school recruitment, classroom inclusion, and limits to generalizability, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports a large final N=459 with effect sizes, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no a priori sample-size rationale is reported.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "2",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method reports random assignment of students within classrooms to feedback versus control conditions, and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization together with Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence indicate reduced selection bias and no significant baseline differences on initial writing scores or key demographics.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints show a single 90-minute session with an initial essay, an immediate revision, and a new task within the same session (short-term pre–post and transfer comparison) but no delayed follow-up or longer-term longitudinal assessment (Outcome.followup_length_and_type is NR).",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability report that motivation, emotion, and usefulness scales are adapted from validated instruments with reported Cronbach’s alpha values, and that writing is scored by a validated automated algorithm trained on TOEFL texts with documented rater reliability and cross-validated performance; Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training details expert rater training for the training corpus.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation provide a stepwise description of the 90-minute session (drafting, feedback/no-feedback, revision, questionnaires, new task), while Intervention.writing_genre, Intervention.writing_stage, Intervention.writing_task_type, Intervention.setting, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_model_configuration, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.llm_access_policy, and Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy together give detailed information enabling replication of the LLM feedback procedure.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method describes regression models with group as predictor, standardized outcome variables (revision score, new task score, motivation, emotions, usefulness), robust maximum likelihood estimation with complex design to account for classroom clustering, and a covariate robustness check; Outcome.primary_outcome_variables, Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors, and Methodology.unit_of_analysis indicate that analyses appropriately match the individual-level randomized design and outcome types.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Outcome.effect_size_summary report p-values and standardized effect sizes (d) for main outcomes, and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation notes aggregation of scale scores and use of FIML for missing data, but Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics indicates that model assumptions and residual diagnostics are not explicitly examined beyond the use of robust standard errors.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "2",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis mentions a robustness check for revision performance including the initial score as a covariate, and Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation show that results are interpreted in light of feedback and motivation theories with a detailed discussion of design limitations, AI-related risks, and the bounded nature of task-specific effects.",
	"total_quality_score": "17",
	"quality_category": "High",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Single-session randomized trial without longitudinal follow-up or preregistration, with limited reporting of model assumption checks and outlier handling despite reliance on complex regression models and automated scoring.",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "LLM feedback was delivered once via GPT-3.5-turbo using a fixed prompt and configuration controlled by researchers, without students directly interacting with or being told about the AI source, and although temperature and max length are reported, evolving GPT-3.5-turbo behavior may limit exact reproducibility."
