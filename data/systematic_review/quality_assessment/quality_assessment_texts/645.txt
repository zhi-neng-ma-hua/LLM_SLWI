	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly states aims to evaluate Cami AI-SAMR impacts on writing achievement and perceptions, identifies a gap in research on Cami AI within the SAMR framework, and situates the work in established models of technology integration and EFL writing pedagogy.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "1",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, learning_context, discipline, and target_language specify undergraduate EFL students in an English education writing class in Indonesia, but Participant Information.language_proficiency, age, sex, and mother_tongue are all NR, leaving key background and demographic variables under-specified.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe purposive sampling of a single EFL Writing Class at one public university, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports N=126 with pre- and post-test statistics, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and there is little discussion of sample representativeness beyond this local context.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization indicate that a single intact class received the intervention with no randomization and no control group, and Outcome.limitation notes the lack of a control group, but there is no detailed consideration of selection, maturation, or other potential biases beyond this acknowledgement.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a one-group pre-test–post-test design with one pre-intervention writing assessment and one post-intervention assessment, while Outcome.followup_length_and_type is NR, so only short-term change is captured without any delayed follow-up to assess longer-term effects.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "1",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Outcome.writing_performance_measure describe course-based pre- and post-test descriptive writing scores and a researcher-designed questionnaire, and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability mentions triangulation of scores, questionnaire, and interview data to support validity, but Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training provides no details on raters, rubrics, or scoring procedures and no reliability coefficients are reported for any instruments.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.intervention_implementation and Intervention.writing_stage give stepwise descriptions of how Cami AI was integrated across SAMR stages (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition), including WhatsApp-based prompts, translation, image generation, grammar checking, and feedback cycles, while Intervention.duration, Intervention.setting, Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, and Intervention.llm_access_policy together provide sufficient detail to broadly replicate the Cami AI-SAMR intervention despite the exact number of weeks or sessions being NR.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports use of SPSS 24 with paired-samples t-tests on pre- and post-test writing scores, which aligns with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors (within-subject comparison of achievement before and after Cami AI-SAMR) and with Methodology.unit_of_analysis (individual students), and no inconsistencies between design, variables, and analytic methods are described.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance provides t, df, and p-values for pre–post score differences and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation notes that raw scores were analyzed without transformation, but Outcome.effect_size_summary states that standardized effect sizes were not reported and Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics indicates that no formal checks of t-test assumptions (e.g., normality, outliers) were described.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, so there is no description of outlier handling or sensitivity analyses, while Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation show that the authors discuss design limitations, implementation challenges, and theoretical and practical implications of the findings, providing some integration with the SAMR and AI-in-education frameworks but without analytic checks for anomalous data patterns.",

	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Single intact-class one-group pre–post design without a control group and limited reporting on writing score rubric, rater procedures, and measurement reliability constrain causal inference and interpretability of gains.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "No",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "Students used a free WhatsApp add-on version of Cami AI (integrating GPT-4/3.5 and other engines) across SAMR stages, but exact model versions, configurations, and duration of exposure were not fully specified, which limits reproducibility and may affect the generalizability of AI-related effects."
