	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly specifies its aims (AI tools plus Uncertain Motivation on Toulmin-based argumentative writing) within an explicit theoretical and contextual gap.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, Participant Information.language_proficiency, Participant Information.learning_context, Participant Information.target_language, Participant Information.age, and Participant Information.discipline provide detailed information on year of study, proficiency, context, age range, and major, although mother tongue and sex are NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe convenience sampling of one Essay Writing course (N=60) with noted limits on generalizability, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports ANOVA and correlations, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no explicit rationale for sample size is given.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization indicate that all 60 students in a single intact class received the same intervention without randomization or a control group, and Outcome.limitation acknowledges the absence of a comparison group, but no further baseline or selection-bias analysis is possible.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "2",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a one-group repeated-measures design with four successive Toulmin-based argumentative writing tasks over several weeks, and analyses track changes in scores and AI-use relationships across these time points, though there is no long-term follow-up.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument specifies an analytical Toulmin-based rubric and coding scheme, Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability reports high inter-rater reliability (Cohen kappa≈0.87 and 0.80–0.91) and normality checks, and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training notes independent scoring and resolution of disagreements.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation outline four weeks of Toulmin training followed by four weeks of in-class AI-supported argumentative writing, while Intervention.setting, Intervention.writing_task_type, Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.llm_access_policy, and Intervention.llm_safety_guardrails together provide replicable detail on tasks, AI use, ethical rules, and teacher and AI roles, despite missing technical model configuration.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method describes use of normality tests, one-way ANOVA across four tasks, paired t-tests, and Pearson correlations, which align with the one-group repeated-measures design and the Outcome.primary_outcome_variables and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors, with Methodology.unit_of_analysis specifying essays and students as the analysis units.",

	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes Shapiro–Wilk and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests for normality, and Outcome.statistical_significance with Outcome.effect_size_summary reports F values and correlations between AI use and outcomes, but no effect sizes for the main ANOVA (e.g., eta squared) or further diagnostics (such as homogeneity checks or outlier analyses) are described.",

	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, while Outcome.limitation and Outcome.implication, together with Methodology.theoretical_foundation, discuss design constraints (single group, short duration) and interpret results in relation to Toulmin-based argumentation, Uncertain Motivation, and AI-supported writing, providing some theoretical integration but no explicit treatment of outliers or robustness checks.",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "ChatGPT was used as an in-class argumentative writing assistant under explicit ethical-use rules, but the specific model version, configuration, and detailed logging of AI interactions were not reported, which limits reproducibility and precise interpretation of AI exposure and effects."
