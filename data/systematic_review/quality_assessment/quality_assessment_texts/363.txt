	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly specifies aims about ChatGPT-based formative feedback, writing attributes and TAM constructs, highlights gaps in AI feedback use and revision processes, and grounds the work in formative feedback theory, TAM and related technology adoption frameworks.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, Participant Information.language_proficiency, Participant Information.learning_context, Participant Information.target_language and Participant Information.age describe upper-intermediate Level 3 undergraduates (average age ≈24) studying English in a Saudi EFL institute, although Participant Information.sex and Participant Information.mother_tongue are NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness report targeted sampling of 50 upper-intermediate students from a single English language institute with limited generalisability, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect provides Ns, means and test statistics, but Methodology.power_analysis notes that no formal a priori power calculation or explicit sample-size justification was conducted.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization describe a one-group pretest–posttest design using a single targeted cohort without a non-AI control group, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence is NA, so allocation and design are reported but potential selection, maturation and history biases cannot be ruled out.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration and Outcome.assessment_timepoints indicate a 16-week intervention with pre- and post-intervention essay ratings and repeated TAM surveys, but there are only two main quantitative time points and no delayed follow-up or extended modelling of longer-term effects beyond the semester.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "1",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability state that the writing rubric and TAM survey were previously validated and that multiple ESL raters plus a specialist reviewer applied the rubric, and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training describes rater training and expert-judgment scoring, yet no numeric reliability indices (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha, inter-rater coefficients) or validity statistics are reported for this sample.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation describe a 16-week sequence of ChatGPT workshops, in-class essay writing without AI, Blackboard submission, ChatGPT formative feedback, think-aloud protocols and reflective presentations, while LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.llm_access_policy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.setting) provide detailed information on how ChatGPT was integrated as a feedback tool, enabling approximate replication despite NR for precise model configuration and safety guardrails.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports paired-samples t-tests, one-way repeated-measures MANOVA, ANOVA, correlation and multiple regression applied to rubric scores and TAM variables in a single-cohort pre–post design, which is consistent with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables, Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors and Methodology.unit_of_analysis that treat time and TAM constructs as predictors of individual-level outcomes.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Outcome.effect_size_summary present extensive t and F statistics, p-values, a multivariate Pillai’s Trace and regression R² values, but Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics is NR for explicit checks of normality or homogeneity, and standardized effect-size indices such as Cohen’s d or partial eta squared are not reported.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation do not describe any procedures for identifying or handling outliers or conducting sensitivity analyses, although Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication and Methodology.theoretical_foundation show that results are interpreted in relation to TAM, formative feedback and metacognitive frameworks with acknowledgement of sample and design constraints.",
	"total_quality_score": "14",
	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Single-cohort one-group pretest–posttest design without a control group and limited reporting of instrument reliability, statistical assumptions, attrition and outlier handling weaken causal inference and generalisability.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "ChatGPT was used only after in-class essay drafting as a formative feedback tool within trained and monitored cycles, but the specific model version, configuration parameters, safety guardrails and objective usage logs were not reported, limiting precise replication and interpretation of AI-related effects."
