	"llm_type_brief": "ChatGPT (OpenAI, Version 3.5)",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly states its aims to compare ChatGPT-based revision with teacher instruction on TOEFL-iBT-rated writing and to examine their respective roles, situating this within writing process and sociocultural frameworks and the debate on AI versus teacher roles.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, language_proficiency, learning_context, target_language, and discipline indicate undergraduate EFL learners at a public university with constrained prior writing scores and mapped TOEFL/CEFR levels, although age, sex, and mother_tongue are NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe purposive sampling from about 1,000 undergraduates via prior exam scores at a single institution, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports N=50 and detailed pre/post statistics, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and there is little discussion of sample size justification or broader representativeness.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization show that learners were purposively selected and then divided into ChatGPT and teacher groups without reported random allocation or allocation concealment, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence notes similar prior and pre-test scores but no formal statistical test of baseline equivalence between groups.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration, Outcome.assessment_timepoints, and Outcome.followup_length_and_type indicate a two-group pre-test–immediate post-revision design with no delayed follow-up, so time effects are limited to a single short-term pre–post comparison rather than extended longitudinal tracking.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "1",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability report use of official TOEFL-iBT Independent Writing rubrics, three expert raters, and standard scaled-score and CEFR mappings to support construct validity, but Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training notes that rater training and inter-rater reliability statistics are not reported.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation provide a stepwise description of pre-test writing, scoring, ChatGPT revision or teacher-guided revision, and re-scoring, while Intervention.writing_stage, Intervention.writing_task_type, Intervention.setting, Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_model_configuration, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.llm_access_policy, and Intervention.llm_safety_guardrails together describe the single-task ChatGPT 3.5 revising procedure and teacher instruction condition in enough detail to enable approximate replication.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method specifies paired-samples t-tests for within-group pre- versus post-revision comparisons and an independent-samples t-test for between-group comparison of revision scores, which aligns with the two-group pre-test–post-test design, Outcome.primary_outcome_variables, Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors, and the learner-level unit described in Methodology.unit_of_analysis.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Methodology.data_analysis_method report t-values and p-values for within- and between-group comparisons, and Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics mentions Levene’s test but no further normality or homogeneity checks, while Outcome.effect_size_summary notes substantial gains without standardized effect sizes and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation describes score conversion procedures without additional diagnostics.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis acknowledges one deviated ChatGPT revision data point without formal outlier criteria or sensitivity analyses, whereas Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation provide a qualitative integration of results with writing process theory, sociocultural scaffolding, CALL frameworks, and ISTE standards, and discuss sample size, single-task design, non-random grouping, and ethical issues as limitations.",
	"total_quality_score": "14",
	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Purposive non-random group allocation in a small single-institution sample without reported inter-rater reliability or comprehensive assumption checks limits internal validity, generalisability, and statistical robustness of the ChatGPT versus teacher comparisons.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "A one-off revision task used ChatGPT Version 3.5 with a single fixed TOEFL-based prompt and minimal AI literacy training, and while the tool/version and prompt are reported, model parameters, access dates, and technical safety guardrails are not, constraining reproducibility and interpretation of LLM behaviour."
