	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly specifies aims on Gemini’s long-term effects on writing proficiency and anxiety, identifies a concrete longitudinal GenAI gap, and anchors the work in sociocultural theory and proficiency–anxiety co-development.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "1",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, Participant Information.discipline, Participant Information.learning_context, Participant Information.age, Participant Information.sex, and Participant Information.target_language show undergraduate TEFL majors in an Iranian EFL context with reported age range and gender distribution, but Participant Information.language_proficiency and Participant Information.mother_tongue are NR and no standardized proficiency levels are provided.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe recruitment from four academic writing classes at a single public university with total N=274 and note the context-specific nature of the sample, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports detailed LGCM slopes and p-values, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no a priori sample-size justification or formal representativeness discussion beyond the single-site context is given.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization indicate computerized random assignment to Gemini-assisted and traditional control groups with the same instructor, materials, and separate sessions to reduce contamination, yet Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence notes that no explicit statistical tests comparing baseline writing proficiency and anxiety between groups are reported.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "2",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration, Outcome.assessment_timepoints, and Outcome.primary_outcome_variables describe a 16-week course with three repeated assessments (Weeks 1, 8, and 16) for writing proficiency and anxiety, analyzed via latent growth curve modeling to capture change trajectories over time, although no post-course delayed follow-up was included.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "1",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability state that the L2 Writing Anxiety Scale (L2WAS) is a validated instrument with Cronbach’s alpha=0.89 and that CATW is an established standardized test, and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training notes two trained raters using the CATW rubric, but inter-rater reliability coefficients for writing scores and detailed rater training procedures are not reported.",

	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports the use of latent growth curve modeling within SEM, with intercept and slope factors for CATW and L2WAS scores and model fit indices (RMSEA, CFI, TLI, SRMR), which is appropriate for the repeated-measures longitudinal design described in Methodology.research_design and aligns with Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors and Methodology.unit_of_analysis at the individual learner level.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect provide LGCM slope estimates, standard errors, critical ratios, p-values, and a covariance between slopes, and Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes examination of SEM model fit indices, but Outcome.effect_size_summary confirms that conventional standardized effect sizes (e.g., Cohen’s d) are not reported and additional diagnostics or data transformations beyond those in Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation are not detailed.",

	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, indicating no reported procedures for detecting or handling outliers or conducting sensitivity analyses, whereas Outcome.limitation, Outcome.implication, Outcome.other_outcomes_focus, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation show that results are interpreted within a sociocultural and GenAI-mediated framework with discussion of contextual limitations, tool specificity, and the co-development of proficiency and anxiety.",

	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Although the study uses a randomized longitudinal design with LGCM, the absence of reported baseline equivalence tests, inter-rater reliability statistics for writing scores, effect-size estimates, and any outlier or missing-data handling procedures constrains internal validity and the precision of impact estimates for Gemini-assisted instruction.",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "Gemini served as the sole GenAI writing assistant across all writing stages for the treatment group, but the specific Gemini model version, prompting strategies, user training, and technical safety or content-filter settings are not reported, limiting reproducibility and detailed interpretation of the LLM’s role in the observed trajectories."
