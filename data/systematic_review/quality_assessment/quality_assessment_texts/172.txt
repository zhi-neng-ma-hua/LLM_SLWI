	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly specifies its aims, situates a ChatGPT-based data-driven learning model within constructivist theory, and identifies a concrete gap in EFL academic writing instruction.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, Participant Information.language_proficiency, Participant Information.learning_context, Participant Information.mother_tongue, Participant Information.age, Participant Information.sex and Participant Information.target_language jointly report the education stage, minimum CEFR proficiency, EFL context, approximate L1 background, age range, roughly balanced gender distribution and L2, providing core demographic and language background information.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect describe convenience sampling of three intact classes with N=92 and report pretest/posttest statistics, and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness notes limited generalizability, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no formal sample size justification is reported.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization indicate that intact classes were randomly designated as control, Experimental Group 1 and Experimental Group 2, while Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence reports significant pretest differences and reliance on ANCOVA adjustment, leaving residual concerns about selection bias and baseline non-equivalence.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration and Outcome.assessment_timepoints show a pretest–posttest design over a fifteen-week course with one pretest and one posttest administered two days after the final class, without any delayed or follow-up measurements to assess longer-term effects.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "1",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability report blinded analytic scoring of essays by three experienced assessors and high internal consistency for the questionnaires (Cronbach’s alpha ≈ .95), but Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training does not provide formal inter-rater reliability statistics or detailed rater training procedures for writing scores.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration, Intervention.intervention_implementation, Intervention.writing_stage and Intervention.setting, together with Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_model_configuration, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.llm_access_policy and Intervention.llm_safety_guardrails, give a detailed account of the 10-session course structure, writing tasks, ChatGPT paraphrasing workflow, guided comparison worksheets, teacher and student roles, access restrictions and ethical guidelines, allowing for reasonable replication.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "1",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method, Outcome.primary_outcome_variables, Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors and Methodology.unit_of_analysis indicate that ANOVA on pretest scores and ANCOVA on posttest writing scores (with pretest as covariate) at the individual-student level were used to compare three teaching methods, which broadly matches the pretest–posttest multi-group design but does not model the class-level clustering inherent in the intact-class assignment.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Outcome.effect_size_summary report ANCOVA F values, p values and within-group Cohen’s d effect sizes for writing gains, while Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation do not describe formal checks of ANCOVA assumptions (e.g., normality, homogeneity of regression slopes) or other detailed diagnostics.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, but Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge and Outcome.implication, together with Methodology.theoretical_foundation, discuss limitations such as baseline non-equivalence, contextual constraints and ethical concerns and interpret findings within a data-driven learning and constructivist framework, without specific treatment of outliers or sensitivity analyses.",
	"total_quality_score": "13",
	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Quasi-experimental intact-class design with substantial baseline group differences despite ANCOVA adjustment, and no reported inter-rater reliability for writing scores or formal ANCOVA assumption checks.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) was used only in-class on mobile devices to paraphrase students’ own essays within guided data-driven learning worksheets, with model version identified but prompts, technical parameters and potential out-of-class use not systematically documented, limiting exact reproducibility and interpretation."
