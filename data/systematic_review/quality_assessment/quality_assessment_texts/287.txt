	"llm_type_brief": "ChatGPT (latest version)",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims and Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, the study clearly aims to compare three levels of ChatGPT integration (Restricted, Guided, Free) on L2-English academic writing and to explore instructor perspectives, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation locates this within the Writer(s) Within Community model and related L2 writing theory.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, language_proficiency, learning_context, target_language, sex and discipline show Korean university students in general English academic writing courses with low to mid-intermediate L2-English proficiency in an EFL context; age and mother_tongue are NR but at least one demographic variable (sex) and key language background variables are reported.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.group_assignment_method describe convenience sampling of three intact classes at one university assigned to Restricted, Guided, and Free conditions, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect provides total N=103 and group sizes with ANCOVA effect sizes, while Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness notes limited generalisability; however, Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no formal sample size justification is reported.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "2",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization state that intact classes were non-randomly assigned to the three conditions, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence reports no significant pretest differences among groups, while Outcome.limitation acknowledges potential cohort and temporal confounds, indicating clear reporting of allocation and related bias risks.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "2",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a pretest in Week 4, two immediate posttests in Weeks 9 and 13, and a delayed posttest in Week 15, all using timed essays scored with the same rubric and analysed via ANCOVAs, so both short-term and delayed effects of ChatGPT integration are examined; Outcome.followup_length_and_type confirms the within-semester delayed posttest design.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument specifies a validated analytic rubric (Kim et al., 2023) scoring content, organization and language use for timed academic essays, and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability reports use of trained raters, inter-rater agreement over 90%, Cronbach’s alpha of 0.77, and ANCOVA assumption checks, while Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training details multiple raters and consensus procedures, providing evidence of reliability and validity for L2-writing measures.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation outline a semester-long sequence of pre-writing, drafting and post-writing activities with specified test weeks and access rules for each group, and LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, llm_model_configuration, llm_integration_mode, prompting_strategy, training_support_llm_literacy, role_llm, role_instructor, llm_access_policy, llm_safety_guardrails) describe how ChatGPT was accessed, guided or restricted, and embedded in class activities, providing sufficient detail to approximate replication despite missing exact prompts and model version.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports one-way ANOVA for pretest and ANCOVAs for immediate and delayed posttest total and rubric scores with pretest as covariate, along with partial eta squared and Bonferroni post hoc tests, which align with the three-group between-subjects quasi-experimental design and continuous outcome variables described in Outcome.primary_outcome_variables and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors at the individual-student level (Methodology.unit_of_analysis).",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "2",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Outcome.effect_size_summary report F values, p values and partial η2 for treatment and covariate effects across total and rubric scores, and Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes Shapiro–Wilk tests for normality and checks of homogeneity of variance and regression slopes, while Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation describes use of covariates and standard ANCOVA procedures; no additional diagnostics are detailed but key assumptions and effect sizes are reported.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR and there is no description of formal outlier handling or sensitivity analyses, but Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication and Methodology.theoretical_foundation provide a theoretically framed discussion of cohort effects, fairness of AI access, evolving ChatGPT versions and how structured versus free AI use relate to content, organization and language outcomes within the Writer(s) Within Community framework.",
	"total_quality_score": "18",
	"quality_category": "High",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Non-random intact-class assignment at a single university and lack of power analysis or explicit outlier handling, together with untracked out-of-class ChatGPT use and unspecified model versions, limit causal attribution and generalisability of the AI integration effects.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "ChatGPT was described only as the latest version without detailed configuration, used under differing access rules across intact cohorts and with unmonitored out-of-class usage, which constrains reproducibility and precise estimation of AI dosage and version-specific effects."
