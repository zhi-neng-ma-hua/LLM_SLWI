	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly states its aims to explore EFL students’ AI use and effectiveness, identifies a contextual research gap in Vietnamese blended higher education, and explicitly draws on Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "1",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, Participant Information.learning_context, and Participant Information.target_language specify first-year EFL undergraduates in a blended English writing context, but Participant Information.age, Participant Information.sex, Participant Information.mother_tongue, and detailed standardized proficiency are NR, so key demographic and language background variables are incomplete.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect report purposive sampling of 103 survey participants and 45 writing-sample volunteers, and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness notes limited generalisability to one Vietnamese university, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no explicit sample-size justification is provided.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method describes a within-subject design in which each of the 45 students wrote both non-AI and AI-assisted essays with no random assignment to different conditions, and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization notes lack of randomisation and potential confounding, while Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence is NA.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Outcome.assessment_timepoints indicate a short-term within-subject comparison where each student produced one essay without AI and one with AI on the same prompt, but there is no delayed follow-up or extended longitudinal assessment of sustained effects.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "1",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability show that survey items were grounded in Ajzen’s TPB and writing samples were scored by trained raters using IELTS band descriptors, but Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability note that no inter-rater reliability statistics or survey reliability indices are reported.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "1",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation describe a paired 200-word argumentative writing task with one essay written independently and one with AI assistance, and Intervention.writing_stage and Intervention.llm_model_type outline typical AI tools and stages of use, but Intervention.llm_model_configuration and Intervention.llm_safety_guardrails are NR and prompting procedures are learner-driven rather than standardised, limiting full replicability.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports use of SPSS descriptive statistics and paired-sample comparisons of IELTS-based writing scores with versus without AI, which matches the within-subject design and the individual-student unit in Methodology.unit_of_analysis and Outcome.primary_outcome_variables, and qualitative interviews were analysed with thematic analysis appropriate to the research questions.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance reports a statistically significant mean gain of 0.94 IELTS bands from 5.81 to 6.76 with AI assistance, but Outcome.effect_size_summary notes that standardized effect sizes (e.g., Cohen’s d) are not reported and Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics states that tests of statistical assumptions are not described, with Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation mentioning only basic comparison of band scores.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Outcome.limitation and Outcome.challenge acknowledge lack of a control group, restricted context, and risks of over-reliance on AI, and Outcome.implication links findings to digital literacy and guided AI integration within the TPB-informed framework (Methodology.theoretical_foundation), but Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR and no explicit procedures for handling outliers or conducting sensitivity analyses are reported.",
	"total_quality_score": "12",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "Multiple external AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, QuillBot, Grammarly, DeepSeek, Grok) were allowed with learner-driven prompting, and Study Quality and Reporting.llm_version_reproducibility notes that tool versions and configurations were not reported, limiting reproducibility and clarity about which AI features contributed to the observed writing gains."
