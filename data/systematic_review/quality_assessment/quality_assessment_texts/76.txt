	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly states its aims to compare ChatGPT-assisted and traditional instruction for writing skills and motivation in a Vietnamese EFL context, identifies a specific empirical gap, and grounds the design in social constructivism, motivation theory, and TPACK.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, language_proficiency, learning_context, target_language, age, sex, and discipline describe intermediate first-year English majors aged 18–20 in an EFL university context in Vietnam, while Participant Information.mother_tongue is NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "2",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness explain that eligible students from two intact first-year BA English Language classes at one university were identified and randomly assigned to experimental and control groups, Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports N = 76 with detailed ANCOVA results and partial η² values, and Methodology.power_analysis documents an a priori power analysis with planned inflation for potential attrition.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "2",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization report computerized random assignment of eligible students to ChatGPT-assisted and control groups and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence notes no significant pre-test differences in GPA or writing proficiency, while Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_blinding indicates that blinding procedures were not described.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a 15-week pre-test–post-test control-group design with pre-test and motivation questionnaire in Week 1, six assignments during Weeks 2–14, and post-test and questionnaire in Week 15, and Outcome.followup_length_and_type confirms that no delayed follow-up beyond the semester was conducted.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability report use of the IELTS Academic Writing rubric with high inter-rater reliability (r = 0.88) and a 25-item motivation questionnaire with strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.89) adapted from prior work, and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training states that experienced IELTS instructors independently rated all essays, although detailed rater training procedures are not described.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation outline a 15-week curriculum with six writing assignments and three clearly defined phases of ChatGPT integration for the experimental group alongside parallel traditional instruction for the control group, specifying timing and tasks. Intervention.writing_genre, Intervention.writing_stage, Intervention.writing_task_type, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.llm_access_policy, Intervention.llm_safety_guardrails, and Intervention.setting provide detailed information on IELTS-style tasks, multi-stage AI use, prompting workshops, interaction logs, graded critical engagement with ChatGPT, and restrictions for the control group, although Intervention.llm_model_configuration and Study Quality and Reporting.llm_version_reproducibility indicate that the exact ChatGPT model version and configuration were not reported.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method and Methodology.unit_of_analysis indicate that individual students’ writing and motivation scores were analyzed using ANCOVA with instructional condition (ChatGPT-assisted vs control) as the between-group factor and pre-test scores as covariates, with partial eta squared reported as effect sizes. Outcome.primary_outcome_variables and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors show that these analyses match the pre-test–post-test control-group design and the continuous IELTS and motivation measures.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "2",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Outcome.effect_size_summary report ANCOVA F values, p values, and partial η² for all major writing and motivation outcomes, providing explicit effect size information. Methodology.data_analysis_method and Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics state that normality and homogeneity assumptions were checked before conducting ANCOVA, and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation notes that scores were entered and analyzed without additional transformations.",

	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation describe constraints on generalizability, time frame, and unmodeled individual differences and interpret the results within social constructivist, motivational, and TPACK frameworks.
