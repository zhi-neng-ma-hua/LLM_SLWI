	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly specifies examining DeepSeek-assisted writing effects on multiple writing dimensions and proficiency-related factors, situates this in multi-dimensional L2 writing and AI-assisted writing research, and highlights novelty in focusing on DeepSeek and proficiency-dependent effects.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "1",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, language_proficiency, learning_context, mother_tongue, discipline and target_language indicate third-year Chinese English majors in an advanced EFL course with TEM-4-based proficiency data, but Participant Information.age and sex are NR, so demographic details are incomplete despite good coverage of language background variables.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe convenience sampling of 31 third-year English majors from a single Chinese university and note limited generalisability, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports N and key test statistics, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no explicit rationale for the small sample size is provided.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization state that all 31 students formed a single intact cohort in a repeated-measures design with no separate control group, and Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence is marked NA; allocation is clearly described but potential temporal and design-related biases are acknowledged rather than systematically addressed.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "2",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a six-week repeated-measures design with baseline (two unassisted writings), a four-week intervention with alternating DeepSeek-assisted and traditional writing, and a follow-up phase with two unassisted writings, and Outcome.followup_length_and_type notes this short-term follow-up, allowing analysis of both immediate and retained effects over time.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument details a five-dimension analytic rubric tailored to EFL writing (content, organization, vocabulary, accuracy, mechanics) with weighted total scores and use of TEM-4 for proficiency, while Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training report clearly defined criteria, two experienced teacher raters with Cohen’s kappa=0.67, double-blind scoring, and mediation by a third rater, providing substantial evidence of reliability and validity for the L2 writing measures.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation outline a three-phase, six-week sequence with specified numbers and timing of AI-assisted versus traditional writings, Intervention.writing_stage and Intervention.writing_task_type describe 30-minute in-class compositions across phases, and LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, llm_model_configuration, llm_integration_mode, prompting_strategy, training_support_llm_literacy, role_llm, role_instructor, llm_access_policy, llm_safety_guardrails) together depict how DeepSeek was introduced, when it was allowed, and what type of feedback it provided, enabling approximate replication of the instructional design despite missing exact model and prompt details.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "1",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports use of SPSS 27 with independent t-tests comparing baseline to intervention and follow-up phases and a repeated-measures MANOVA on the five rubric dimensions to assess effects of baseline proficiency and AI intervention, with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors specifying the writing dimensions and instruction modes as key variables and Methodology.unit_of_analysis indicating the individual student as the analysis unit; however, the use of independent t-tests in a single-group repeated-measures design and limited detail on the MANOVA structure leave some uncertainty about full alignment between design and statistical methods.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Outcome.effect_size_summary report p-values and partial eta squared for t-tests and MANOVA (e.g., large multivariate effects for baseline proficiency and AI intervention), and Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics notes Shapiro–Wilk normality testing for TEM-4 and inspection of correlations and variance–covariance structure among rubric dimensions, but there is no detailed reporting of assumption checks for the main outcome variables or MANOVA residuals and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation lists only weighting and proficiency grouping, so assumption handling is only partially documented.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR with no explicit procedures for detecting or handling outliers, yet Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge and Outcome.implication, together with Methodology.theoretical_foundation, provide a theoretically framed discussion of the small single-group design, limited timeframe, process-level unknowns, and proficiency-dependent benefits and risks (over-reliance, cognitive overload), integrating findings with methodological constraints and pedagogical implications.",

	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Single-group convenience sample without a separate control group and small N, combined with limited reporting of assumption checks, no outlier handling, and unspecified DeepSeek configuration and usage logging, restricts causal inference, generalisability, and reproducibility of the AI intervention effects.",

	"design_note_llm_specific": "DeepSeek model version, interface, prompts, and interaction logs were not reported, and students received minimal explicit LLM literacy guidance, making AI exposure and engagement patterns difficult to quantify or replicate and complicating interpretation of proficiency-dependent DeepSeek effects."
