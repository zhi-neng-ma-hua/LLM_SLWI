	"llm_type_brief": "ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly specifies ChatGPT-based writing instruction (CGWIP) effects on teacher self-efficacy, learner writing skills, and retention, and situates this within gaps on AI tools and teacher psycho-emotional variables using Positive Psychology and Social-Cognitive Theory.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, language_proficiency, learning_context, mother_tongue, target_language, age, sex, and discipline report that adult tertiary-level Iranian EFL learners (intermediate by OPT) and in-service EFL teachers (with specified age ranges and gender distribution) took part in online EFL writing classes, providing detailed linguistic and demographic background.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "2",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe convenience recruitment of 12 teachers via Telegram, clustered random assignment to experimental/control groups, and selection of four intermediate learners per teacher within a single national EFL context, while Methodology.sample_size_and_effect and Methodology.power_analysis report sample sizes, key test statistics, and a teacher-level power justification referencing Cohen’s recommendations, alongside comments on limited generalizability.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "2",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method indicates random assignment of teachers to experimental versus control conditions with clustered learner allocation, and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization plus Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence report no significant pre-test differences on OPT and teacher self-efficacy and use of pre-test writing as an ANCOVA covariate with homogeneity of regression slopes checked, supporting clear allocation procedures and baseline comparability.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "2",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a 10-week intervention with learner writing pre-test, immediate post-test, and a 1-week delayed post-test using new IELTS tasks, plus teacher self-efficacy pre- and post-tests, and Outcome.statistical_significance and Outcome.effect_size_summary indicate explicit analyses of both immediate and short-term retention effects.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability report established instruments (OPT, IELTS tasks with 9-band descriptors, TSES) with KR-21 reliability for OPT (r=.71), Cronbach’s alpha for TSES (α=.785–.858), and strong inter-rater reliability between ChatGPT and a human IELTS expert for writing scores (r≈.65–.70), while Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training describes dual rating and high Cohen’s Kappa (94% agreement), providing substantial reliability and appropriateness evidence for L2 writing assessment.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation give a structured 10-week, two-sessions-per-week CGWIP versus process-writing control description with detailed planning, instruction, and assessment phases, and the LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_model_configuration, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.llm_access_policy, Intervention.llm_safety_guardrails) specify how premium ChatGPT-3.5 accounts were used by teachers and learners, under what supervision, and for which writing stages, allowing broad reproducibility of the protocol.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method explains that SPSS 26 was used with independent-samples t-tests for OPT and teacher TSES and ANCOVA for learner writing post-tests using pre-test scores as covariate, while Outcome.primary_outcome_variables, Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors, and Methodology.unit_of_analysis clarify that individual teachers and learners were the analysis units, so the selected tests align with the group-by-time structure and outcome scales.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "2",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics and Methodology.data_analysis_method state that normality, homogeneity of variances (Levene’s), linearity, and homogeneity of regression slopes were checked and met, and Outcome.statistical_significance together with Outcome.effect_size_summary report p-values, partial η² for ANCOVA, and effect size r for t-tests, fulfilling both assumption checking and effect size reporting.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, so no explicit outlier handling or sensitivity analyses are described, although Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation integrate findings with Positive Psychology and Social-Cognitive Theory and acknowledge sample, context, and AI-related constraints when interpreting results.",
	"total_quality_score": "19",
	"quality_category": "High",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Clustered randomization with small teacher and learner samples from a single EFL context, no reported outlier or sensitivity analyses, and incomplete detail on how dual ChatGPT–human writing ratings were combined.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "CGWIP used premium ChatGPT-3.5 accounts for teachers and learners across planning, instruction, feedback, and assessment—including dual ChatGPT–human IELTS rating—without full disclosure of prompt scripts or platform-level settings, which may limit precise replication and comparability across LLM versions."
