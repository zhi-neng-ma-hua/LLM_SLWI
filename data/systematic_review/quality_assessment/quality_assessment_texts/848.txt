	"llm_type_brief": "ChatGPT (OpenAI large language model)",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims and Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, the study clearly states its aims (effects of ChatGPT-based instruction on academic writing skills, writing motivation, and learner perceptions) and articulates a specific gap in holistic evaluation of AI-assisted academic writing, while Methodology.theoretical_foundation anchors the work in Vygotskian social constructivism and AI as a virtual peer.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, .language_proficiency, .learning_context, .target_language, .age, .sex, and .discipline indicate undergraduate Chinese EFL students aged 18–22 in a national university English program with intermediate to upper-intermediate proficiency and mixed majors, although mother tongue is NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness describe multistage random sampling from one Chinese national university and note limits to generalizability, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports N=50 with detailed test statistics and effect sizes, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and there is no explicit a priori sample-size justification.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization report computer-generated random assignment to experimental and control groups taught by the same instructor, while Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence notes comparable proficiency and use of pre-tests as covariates but no formal baseline comparison tests or allocation concealment details, leaving some uncertainty about selection and performance bias.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a 12-week pre-test/post-test design with writing and motivation measured before and immediately after the intervention, whereas Outcome.followup_length_and_type states that no delayed follow-up was conducted, so only short-term change is captured.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument details use of standardized IELTS academic writing tasks with official band descriptors and an adapted Writing Motivation Scale, while Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training report high inter-rater reliability for writing scores (r=0.88) and good internal consistency for motivation (α=0.86), with member checking for interviews, providing substantial evidence of reliability and validity for core measures.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation specify a 12-week, twice-weekly program with matched materials and teacher across groups, and LLM-related fields (Intervention.llm_model_type, .llm_model_configuration, .llm_integration_mode, .prompting_strategy, .training_support_llm_literacy, .role_llm, .role_instructor, .llm_access_policy, .llm_safety_guardrails, plus writing_stage and setting) describe ChatGPT access, usage patterns, instructional roles, and ethical guidance in sufficient detail to broadly replicate the AI-assisted and control conditions.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports independent-samples t-tests and one-way ANCOVAs with group as factor and pre-test scores as covariates, aligned with Outcome.primary_outcome_variables (writing and motivation scores) and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors (instructional condition), and Methodology.unit_of_analysis confirms the individual student as the analysis unit, indicating good correspondence between design, variables, and statistical methods.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "2",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics states that ANCOVA assumptions (normality, linearity, equality of variances, homogeneity of regression slopes, and covariate reliability) were checked, and Outcome.statistical_significance together with Outcome.effect_size_summary and Methodology.data_analysis_method report t-values, F-values, p-values, Cohen’s d, and partial eta squared without additional transformations beyond those noted in Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR with no explicit description of outlier handling or sensitivity analyses, but Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation integrate findings with Vygotskian theory, acknowledge sample and design constraints, and discuss issues such as over-reliance on AI and plagiarism risk, providing conceptual but not data-analytic treatment of potential anomalies.",
	"total_quality_score": "16",
	"quality_category": "High",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Single-institution sample without reported power analysis or formal baseline tests, combined with lack of detail on attrition, rater blinding, and outlier handling, may introduce bias and limit generalizability and internal validity.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "Students in the experimental group accessed ChatGPT via a custom web-based interface for in-class and at-home drafting and revision, but the specific model version and parameter settings were not reported, which constrains exact reproducibility and interpretation of the AI-assisted component."
