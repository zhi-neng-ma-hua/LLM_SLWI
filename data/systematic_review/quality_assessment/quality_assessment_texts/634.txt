	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly aims to evaluate an AI-supported PAL intervention for EFL academic writing, identifies the combined impact of AI tools and PAL as under-explored, and explicitly grounds the work in process-oriented writing pedagogy, social constructivism, DDL, and AI-in-education literature.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, language_proficiency, learning_context, target_language, mother_tongue, discipline, and prior_experience_llm describe first- and second-year undergraduates from various programs in an EFL academic writing context in Thailand, with CEFR B2 or higher proficiency and multiple L1s (Thai, Burmese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, European and Middle Eastern languages), although overall sex and exact ages are NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness report stratified random sampling of 143 CEFR B2+ undergraduates from a frame of 245 students, and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect provides N and pre–post writing score changes, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and discussion of representativeness is limited to noting restricted generalizability beyond this specific international EFL context.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "1",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method and Methodology.research_design indicate that all 143 sampled students were placed in a single experimental condition without a control group, and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization acknowledges the absence of randomization and potential bias from maturation and other uncontrolled factors over time, while baseline group equivalence is not applicable in this one-group design.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "According to Methodology.research_design, Intervention.duration, and Outcome.assessment_timepoints, the study uses a 15-week one-group pre–post design with IELTS-style opinion essays at the start and end of the course, but Outcome.followup_length_and_type is NR and no delayed follow-up assessments are reported, so only short-term change is examined.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training describe pre- and post-test IELTS-style essays scored by two trained evaluators using standardized band descriptors with consensus procedures, and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability reports expert review, pilot testing, IOC=1.0, and Cronbach’s alpha=0.949 for the 12-item questionnaire, although no numerical inter-rater reliability coefficient for essay ratings is provided.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "2",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation give detailed information on the 15-week course structure, weekly writing and ChatGPT-based reflection activities, and 10 weeks of PAL center mentoring, while Intervention.llm_model_type, llm_model_configuration, llm_integration_mode, prompting_strategy, training_support_llm_literacy, role_llm, role_instructor, llm_access_policy, writing_stage, writing_task_type, and setting together specify how ChatGPT and PAL were integrated in sufficient detail for approximate replication despite unspecified model version parameters.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method reports the use of a paired samples t-test on pre- and post-test IELTS-style band scores, with individual students as the unit of analysis (Methodology.unit_of_analysis) and Outcome.primary_outcome_variables focused on writing proficiency bands, which is appropriate for the one-group pre–post design, supplemented by descriptive statistics and reliability analysis for the questionnaire.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Methodology.sample_size_and_effect indicate a statistically significant mean increase of 0.9 IELTS-style band points (p<0.05) from pre- to post-test and describe questionnaire means, while Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation notes direct use of band scores and Likert means, but Outcome.effect_size_summary is NR and Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics states that normality, outliers, and other t-test assumptions were not reported.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR and Study Quality and Reporting.attrition_and_missing_data notes incomplete reporting of questionnaire participation without describing missing-data procedures, whereas Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation provide a qualitative integration of findings with social constructivist and process-writing frameworks, ethical concerns, and rapid AI evolution but without explicit treatment of data outliers or robustness checks.",

	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Single-group pre–post design without a control group and the absence of reported effect sizes, assumption checks, and outlier or sensitivity analyses limit causal inference and the robustness of the reported writing gains.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "No",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "ChatGPT was extensively used for paraphrasing and feedback within class and PAL mentoring, but the model version and parameters were not specified, unsupervised AI use outside structured activities was not controlled, and the evolving nature of ChatGPT during the 15-week course was acknowledged as a limitation, constraining reproducibility and precise attribution of effects to the defined AI plus PAL protocol."
