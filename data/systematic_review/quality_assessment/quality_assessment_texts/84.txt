	"q1_research_aims_clarity_score": "2",
	"q1_research_aims_clarity_notes": "Based on Basic Identification.research_aims, Basic Identification.research_gap_or_novelty, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation, the study clearly states its aim to test ChatGPT-assisted learning effects on five analytic writing dimensions in high school EFL learners, identifies a specific gap at the secondary level with subskill-focused analysis, and frames the work within constructivist learning theory.",
	"q2_participant_info_score": "2",
	"q2_participant_info_notes": "Participant Information.educational_level, language_proficiency, learning_context, target_language, age, and discipline specify high school EFL students aged 16–18 at CEFR A2–B1 in a Saudi high school classroom, though Participant Information.mother_tongue, sex, and prior_experience_llm are NR.",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_score": "1",
	"q3_sampling_and_power_notes": "Methodology.sampling_method and Methodology.sampling_frame_and_representativeness indicate convenience sampling of 10 EFL students from one high school with no claims of broader representativeness, Methodology.sample_size_and_effect reports N=10 and effect sizes from Wilcoxon tests, but Methodology.power_analysis is NR and no a priori justification of the small sample size is provided.",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_score": "0",
	"q4_group_allocation_and_bias_notes": "Methodology.group_assignment_method describes a single-group design with no randomization or comparison group, and Study Quality and Reporting.risk_of_bias_randomization notes that all 10 convenience-sampled students received the same intervention, increasing selection and confounding bias, while Study Quality and Reporting.baseline_equivalence is marked NA.",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_score": "1",
	"q5_longitudinal_design_notes": "Methodology.research_design and Outcome.assessment_timepoints describe a quasi-experimental single-group pre-test–post-test design over a three-week period with pre-test immediately before and post-test immediately after the ChatGPT-assisted intervention, and Outcome.followup_length_and_type indicates no delayed follow-up.",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_score": "2",
	"q6_measurement_reliability_validity_notes": "Methodology.data_collection_instrument and Methodology.data_collection_validity_reliability state that pre- and post-test essays were scored with Jacobs et al.'s ESL Composition Profile, selected for its established reliability, and Methodology.scoring_procedure_and_rater_training reports that two certified EFL teachers independently scored all essays with high inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s kappa=0.87), supporting reliable analytic measurement for this L2 group.",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_score": "1",
	"q7_intervention_procedure_and_duration_notes": "Intervention.duration and Intervention.intervention_implementation outline a three-week AI-assisted writing period in which students drafted essays and used ChatGPT-3.5 for real-time feedback under teacher supervision, and Intervention.llm_model_type, Intervention.llm_integration_mode, Intervention.prompting_strategy, Intervention.role_instructor, Intervention.role_llm, Intervention.llm_access_policy, Intervention.training_support_llm_literacy, Intervention.writing_stage, Intervention.writing_task_type, and Intervention.setting describe general LLM use and classroom context, but session frequency, detailed prompt design, and structured LLM literacy training are not reported, limiting full replicability.",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_score": "2",
	"q8_statistical_method_appropriateness_notes": "Methodology.data_analysis_method and Methodology.unit_of_analysis indicate that individual students’ analytic writing scores were analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests for pre–post comparisons in this small-N single-group design, with effect sizes r computed, and Outcome.primary_outcome_variables and Outcome.independent_variables_and_factors show that these nonparametric tests and a Two-Step Cluster Analysis are appropriate for the pre/post scores and exploratory response patterns.",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_score": "1",
	"q9_assumption_and_effect_size_notes": "Outcome.statistical_significance and Outcome.effect_size_summary report Wilcoxon Z values, p-values, and effect sizes computed as r=Z/√N for each analytic dimension, but Study Quality and Reporting.assumption_check_and_data_diagnostics only notes that Wilcoxon is appropriate for small samples without reporting formal diagnostics, and Study Quality and Reporting.data_preprocessing_and_transformation is NR.",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_score": "1",
	"q10_outliers_and_interpretation_notes": "Study Quality and Reporting.outlier_treatment_and_sensitivity_analysis is NR, while Outcome.limitation, Outcome.challenge, Outcome.implication, and Methodology.theoretical_foundation acknowledge small-sample, single-school, short-duration, and no-control limitations and interpret results within a constructivist framework and AI-assisted learning literature, but do not address outlier handling or sensitivity analyses explicitly.",
	"total_quality_score": "13",
	"quality_category": "Moderate",
	"key_quality_concerns": "Very small convenience single-group sample without control or randomization and a short three-week intervention, with no reported power analysis, outlier handling, or formal assumption diagnostics.",
	"include_in_main_synthesis": "Yes",
	"include_in_meta_analysis": "Yes",
	"design_note_llm_specific": "Students directly used ChatGPT-3.5 as a real-time in-class writing assistant under teacher supervision, but there was no structured GenAI literacy or prompt-training program and limited reporting on prompt design and model configuration, which constrains reproducibility and interpretation of the LLM component."
