		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "After pre-tests in week one, the experimental group engaged in ClipTalk based learning over eight weeks following a staged design: first, authentic context exploration with VTR, where learners captured short videos in real environments according to their preferences, obtained contextual vocabulary via video-to-text recognition and used GPT generated phrases and sentences based on that vocabulary as reference to write descriptive sentences and narratives for their own videos; during this stage the system provided grammar checking guidance and real time automatic speaking scoring while learners practiced reading and speaking their sentences. Next, in the peer video viewing and practicing stage, learners selected peers videos according to their interests, watched these contextual videos with peer created narratives and practiced speaking using peers work, extending their exposure to contextual English expressions. Finally, in the intelligent contextual chatbot stage, learners selected videos and engaged in conversation practice with the contextual chatbot, which generated dialogue questions from VTR vocabulary as keywords and scenario based prompts, adapting complexity to learners proficiency; learners responded in writing and speaking, receiving grammar suggestions and instant feedback during chatbot interactions.
