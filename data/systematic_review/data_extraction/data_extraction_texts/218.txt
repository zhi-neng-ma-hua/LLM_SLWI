		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "ChatGPT (GPT-4-based assistant); Writesonic; Grammarly (AI writing tool; LLM status NR).",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "ChatGPT and a GPT-4-based assistant were accessed as online tools in class and for supervised homework; Writesonic and Grammarly were also used as AI writing assistants; access was via standard web interfaces and Google Docs integration; specific API settings or model parameters were not reported.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students directly interacted with generative AI tools (ChatGPT, GPT-4-based assistant, Writesonic, Grammarly) on computers or online platforms during structured classroom activities and supervised homework, with teachers modelling usage and mediating discussions but not acting as exclusive intermediaries between students and AI.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "GenAI prompts were explicitly designed and tiered using the GenAI-CT framework, the 3R (Report-Revise-Reflect) model, and AI-CRITIQUE protocol to target specific critical thinking dimensions such as analysis, evaluation, inference, and reflection; example prompts included questions like 'What assumptions underlie your argument?', 'How would you respond to a counterargument?', 'Is my evidence strong enough?', and 'What would a critic say?'; AI was also used to generate Socratic-style questions, counterarguments, and requests for stronger evidence.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Students received an initial orientation to critical thinking and academic writing criteria followed by guided training in generative AI use; instructors modelled prompt crafting and iterative questioning strategies, demonstrated how to use AI for analysis rather than mere correction, and trained students to cross-check AI outputs and avoid uncritical acceptance, fostering AI literacy alongside critical thinking development.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "The intervention followed four action research cycles. Week 1: orientation to critical thinking and academic writing; baseline argumentative essay using Google Docs and a CT rubric. Weeks 2–3 (Cycle 1): focus on analysis and reflection using 3R prompts; students wrote and revised essays using AI feedback from ChatGPT and a GPT-4-based assistant. Weeks 4–5 (Cycle 2): focus on evaluation and argumentation; students engaged in peer plus AI-supported critique with ChatGPT and peer feedback sheets. Weeks 6–7 (Cycle 3): focus on rebuttal and strengthening arguments; AI-CRITIQUE prompts and Writesonic were used to support counterargument and rebuttal integration, with teacher-led debrief sessions. Week 8 (Cycle 4): final essay revision and completion of reflective journals on learning processes and AI engagement using AI logs, Grammarly, and reflective templates. Across cycles, students received AI-generated feedback via guided prompts and teacher-annotated feedback, then revised drafts and wrote reflection logs on how AI feedback influenced their reasoning.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "All participating students in the three vocational colleges received the GenAI-CT intervention, which combined AI-mediated cognitive scaffolding, dialogic mediation with generative AI tools, and iterative development of drafts through cycles of drafting, AI critique, teacher feedback, revision, and reflection; no separate experimental versus control groups were created.",

		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Critical thinking-focused argumentative writing tasks and baseline CT writing task, followed by multiple drafts and revisions within four AI-supported action research cycles.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "Generative AI tools acted as dialogic partners and cognitive scaffolds by generating draft text suggestions, posing probing and Socratic questions, proposing counterarguments, critiquing evidence, suggesting lexical and syntactic refinements, and supporting reflective prompts; AI was used to stimulate analysis, evaluation, inference, and reflection rather than to fully automate writing or scoring.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "Instructors in each college served as co-researchers, designing AI-mediated tasks, modelling effective prompt use, guiding students’ engagement with AI, providing teacher-annotated feedback on organization, reasoning depth, and rhetorical clarity, leading activities such as AI Challenge Sessions, AI-assisted debates, and contextual reflection workshops, and facilitating reflection on when to accept, question, or reject AI suggestions.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Face-to-face EFL writing instruction in English writing courses at three vocational colleges in Thailand, supported by online tools (Google Docs, ChatGPT, GPT-4-based assistant, Writesonic, Grammarly) used in class and as supervised homework.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "The article states that the study followed ethical practices during writing and includes a transparency statement confirming an honest and accurate account; specific details about institutional ethical approval procedures or informed consent processes for student participants were not reported.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Students were guided to use generative AI tools within structured classroom and supervised homework contexts for analysis, critique, and revision of their own writing, with explicit emphasis on guided interaction, evaluation and refinement of AI outputs, and avoidance of unstructured or overreliant AI use; policies for unsupervised or extracurricular AI use were not specified.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "Pedagogical guardrails included requiring structured prompts targeting critical thinking dimensions, teacher modelling of sceptical and evaluative AI use, training students to cross-check AI outputs and challenge suggestions, combining AI feedback with teacher and peer input, and designing dual-feedback loops to reduce uncritical dependence; no additional technical safety filters beyond the default behaviour of the AI tools were described.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Across the eight-week GenAI-CT intervention, students in all three vocational colleges showed statistically significant and large gains in critical thinking scores in writing (overall mean increase of about 1.21 points on the CT scale, t(91)=15.34, p<0.001, with Cohen’s d values exceeding 1.1). ANCOVA controlling for pretest scores and college found consistently higher adjusted posttest CT scores with no significant college by intervention interaction, indicating robustness across contexts. NVivo analysis of 184 reflective journal entries showed substantial increases in code frequencies for analytical depth (+77%), evaluative judgment (+86%), inference generation (+83%), and reflective awareness (+73%) from Cycle 1 to Cycle 4, suggesting that structured GenAI prompts and iterative cycles fostered deeper and more metacognitive engagement. Cross-case analysis indicated that disciplinary focus and mediation style shaped dimension-specific gains (e.g., largest evaluation gains in Business English, analysis in International Trade, inference in Hotel Management), while post-study surveys (mean satisfaction ratings above 4.0 on a 5-point scale) and interviews revealed that students generally perceived AI as useful for building vocabulary, improving grammar, clarifying arguments, expanding ideas, and increasing motivation when used under guided, reflective conditions."

		"other_outcomes_measure (其他结果测量工具)": "NVivo-supported thematic analysis of reflective journals and interviews; cross-case comparison metrics including satisfaction ratings and dimension-specific CT gains by college.",
		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "Context-specific differences in which critical thinking dimensions showed the largest gains in different vocational majors, perceived benefits of AI for professional relevance (e.g., linking AI suggestions to real hotel management metrics), and teacher-reported classroom dynamics under different mediation strategies.",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Baseline critical thinking writing task and CT scoring before the intervention (Week 1) and post-intervention critical thinking writing assessment at the end of the eight-week, four-cycle program; no delayed follow-up assessment was reported.",

		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "For critical thinking scores, each college showed significant pre- to post-intervention gains (College A: Δ=+1.29, t(31)=8.92, p<0.001; College B: Δ=+1.13, t(29)=7.65, p<0.001; College C: Δ=+1.21, t(32)=9.10, p<0.001), and the overall sample showed a gain of +1.21 with t(91)=15.34, p<0.001. ANCOVA indicated no significant college-by-intervention interaction (F(2,88)=1.12, p=0.33) and a highly significant adjusted posttest effect (F(1,89)=312.45, p<0.001), confirming robust CT improvement across contexts.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "All Cohen’s d values for pre- to post-intervention CT gains across colleges were above 1.1, and the discussion notes Cohen’s d values of at least 1.42 for some CT dimensions, indicating very large practical effects of the GenAI-CT intervention on critical thinking competence in EFL writing.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The article notes potential risks of unstructured generative AI use leading to dependency and intellectual passivity, where students might accept AI-generated content without questioning its validity; these risks motivated the use of structured prompts, guided interaction, and teacher mediation. The study reports that guided use helped shift students from passively accepting AI suggestions to actively critiquing and sometimes rejecting them; no major instances of observed misuse are detailed, but the authors emphasise the need to teach students to evaluate, challenge, and refine AI outputs rather than rely on them uncritically.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "ANCOVA including pretest scores and gender as covariates and college as a factor found no significant interaction between college and intervention effectiveness, suggesting similar CT gains across the three institutional contexts; the sample included 71% female and 29% male students, but no gender-based differences in outcomes were reported; disciplinary differences by college showed variation in which CT dimension gained most, but these were interpreted as contextual specialisations rather than equity concerns.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "The study focuses on three vocational colleges in one national context using purposive sampling and does not include a non-AI control group for comparison, limiting causal inference relative to alternate instructional conditions; outcomes are examined over an eight-week period without delayed follow-up to assess long-term retention of critical thinking gains; while these design characteristics are evident, explicit limitation statements by the authors beyond general cautions about unstructured AI use were not reported.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Challenges highlighted include the risk that students may initially accept AI suggestions uncritically, the need for substantial teacher mediation to design and facilitate activities such as AI Challenge Sessions, AI-assisted debates, and contextual reflection workshops, the need to train students in prompt crafting and AI literacy to prevent overreliance and superficial automation, and the requirement to align AI prompts with disciplinary contexts to make them meaningful and appropriately demanding.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "NR",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The findings suggest that generative AI can function as an effective cognitive and dialogic scaffold for developing critical thinking in EFL writing when embedded in intentional frameworks such as GenAI-CT; the study provides practical guidance for designing tiered critical thinking prompts, orchestrating dual-layer mediation that combines AI and teacher-led dialogue, sequencing iterative writing and revision cycles, and contextualising AI prompts to vocational disciplines, implying that EFL instructors should adopt structured, reflective, and context-sensitive AI integration rather than unstructured or purely corrective use."
