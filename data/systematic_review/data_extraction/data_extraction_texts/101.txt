		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "For the experimental class, researchers conducted a pre-test of academic writing to assess baseline ability in content, structure and coherence, grammar, linguistic range, vocabulary, spelling, and form, then provided training on using ChatGPT for academic writing. Over 16 weeks, students completed weekly writing tasks on academic topics, used ChatGPT to receive feedback and interact about problems in their writing, and then revised their essays based on ChatGPT feedback and teacher feedback. Researchers supervised and guided ChatGPT use throughout and checked for academic integrity at the end. For the control class, students completed the same pre-test, received weekly academic-topic writing tasks, and received written teacher feedback (e.g., on structure, grammar, vocabulary) without using ChatGPT, revising their writing based on teacher feedback only. After 16 weeks, both classes took a post-test based on PTE writing tasks; the experimental class additionally completed an engagement questionnaire.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Experimental class (n=34) received ChatGPT-based feedback for 16 weeks: students wrote academic texts on assigned topics each week, interacted with ChatGPT to obtain feedback on content, structure and coherence, grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and form, and revised their writing based on ChatGPT feedback plus supplementary teacher feedback.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Control class (n=36) received traditional teacher feedback for 16 weeks: students wrote the same or comparable weekly academic writing tasks and received written feedback from the teacher on content, structure, grammar, vocabulary, and other aspects, revising their texts based solely on teacher feedback; they did not use ChatGPT.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Drafting and revising stages of academic writing; ChatGPT was used primarily for receiving feedback and revising content, structure and coherence, grammar, linguistic range, vocabulary, spelling, and form; pre-test and post-test writing tasks reflected overall writing proficiency but were not described as being completed with ChatGPT assistance.",

		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "ChatGPT acted as an AI assistant that provided instant, personalized writing help and feedback including writing suggestions, vocabulary suggestions, grammar and punctuation corrections, content and organizational suggestions, and guidance on academic expression; it was used interactively as a feedback-giving partner rather than as an automated scorer.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "The instructor assigned academic writing tasks, trained experimental-class students on how to use ChatGPT for academic writing, provided additional written feedback to both groups (particularly the control group), supervised and guided students’ use of ChatGPT to prevent misuse and academic dishonesty, monitored classroom behavior and engagement, and contributed to scoring procedures by collaborating with PTE writing trainers.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "English Academic Writing course in a private EFL university in China, delivered over a 16-week semester with large-class teaching; instruction appears to be primarily face-to-face with ChatGPT accessed online (via VPN where necessary).",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Researchers obtained consent and approval from the university; all participants gave informed consent and signed informed consent forms for using ChatGPT tools in English academic writing; participants were informed they could join or withdraw at any time and were informed of the purpose, benefits, and potential risks of the study; an academic writing integrity statement informed students about plagiarism risks and consequences; researchers supervised ChatGPT use to meet ethical requirements and ensured confidentiality of personal information.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Due to access restrictions on ChatGPT in China, researchers explained how participants could access ChatGPT, including possible use of a virtual VPN; students signed an academic integrity statement and were supervised throughout the study to use ChatGPT reasonably and appropriately for academic writing; ChatGPT use was restricted to supporting writing tasks, not replacing student authorship.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "Ethical guardrails were implemented through academic integrity statements, teacher supervision, guidance on appropriate use to avoid plagiarism and overreliance, and post-hoc checking of students’ academic writing for plagiarism; no additional technical content filters or automated safety mechanisms within ChatGPT were described.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Pre-test independent samples t-test indicated no significant difference in English academic writing ability between experimental and control classes (p=0.970), while post-test results showed a significant advantage for the ChatGPT group (p=0.000, mean difference≈1.93). Paired t-tests indicated that both EC and CC significantly improved overall writing scores, but EC improved more (mean gain 3.206 vs 1.250). At the component level, EC students showed statistically significant improvements across all seven dimensions (content, structure and coherence, grammar, linguistic range, vocabulary, spelling, form), whereas CC students showed significant gains only in content, structure, spelling, and form, with no significant improvement in grammar, linguistic range, or vocabulary. This suggests that ChatGPT-based feedback was particularly effective for enhancing higher-order aspects (content, structure and coherence) and language-related aspects (grammar, linguistic range, vocabulary), while traditional feedback had weaker effects on these language subskills. Engagement data from the experimental class showed that more than 60–70% of students agreed or strongly agreed that ChatGPT had positive effects on affective engagement (interest, enjoyment, motivation, positive atmosphere), cognitive engagement (focus, problem-solving, critical thinking, creativity, personalized learning), social engagement (appreciation of feedback, closer interaction with ChatGPT, exploring topics, reduced concern about others’ opinions, problem-solving), and behavioral engagement (attendance, active participation, abandoning bad behaviors, working harder, seeking opportunities to use ChatGPT). Overall, ChatGPT had a greater positive impact than traditional feedback on both English academic writing ability and engagement."

		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The article cites concerns from the literature about overreliance on ChatGPT, potential reductions in creativity, autonomy, and critical thinking, inaccurate or biased outputs, and lengthy or complex feedback that may lower enthusiasm; to mitigate academic integrity risks, the study required students to sign integrity statements and supervised ChatGPT use. Within the study, no systematic quantitative data on misuse or negative effects were collected, but the authors warn that overdependence on AI can harm independent thinking and call for cautious, guided use.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "No subgroup analyses by gender, age, prior ChatGPT exposure, or other demographic or socio-economic variables were conducted; authors acknowledge that students’ potential prior exposure to ChatGPT and other factors (e.g., learning methods, attitudes toward teachers) may influence outcomes and recommend that future studies consider these confounding factors.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Limitations include the relatively short intervention duration of 16 weeks, small sample size of 70 students from only two classes in a single private university, use of a quasi-experimental design without random assignment at the student level, and absence of a follow-up phase to examine long-term effects; only one AI tool (ChatGPT) was investigated, and access constraints in China required VPN use; the study focused on writing ability and engagement only, though academic writing is influenced by many additional factors; potential bias due to prior exposure to ChatGPT is acknowledged but not controlled; generalizability is limited.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges and risks include limited access to ChatGPT in China requiring VPN solutions, risk of students over-relying on ChatGPT instead of developing independent academic writing skills, possible negative effects on creativity and critical thinking, issues of data privacy and algorithmic bias, difficulty for some students in understanding and acting on ChatGPT feedback, and the need for ongoing teacher supervision to prevent plagiarism and ensure ethically responsible use.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research should involve larger and more diverse samples across multiple institutions and cultural contexts, extend the intervention duration and include longitudinal follow-up, compare ChatGPT with other AI systems (e.g., ERNIE Bot) and hybrid feedback models, investigate the ethical impacts of ChatGPT use (data privacy, algorithmic bias, academic integrity), control for students’ prior exposure to ChatGPT through initial guidance and orientation, and examine additional factors influencing academic writing ability and engagement such as learning strategies, teacher–student relationships, and other contextual variables.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The findings support constructivist and engagement theories by showing that ChatGPT can provide personalized, immediate feedback that helps students actively construct academic writing knowledge and enhances affective, cognitive, social, and behavioral engagement. Pedagogically, combining ChatGPT with traditional teacher feedback can maximize benefits, with ChatGPT particularly effective for content, structure and coherence, and language features (grammar, vocabulary, linguistic range), while teacher feedback remains important for reinforcing mechanics and addressing ethical and critical thinking concerns. The study suggests that English academic writing curricula and policies in China could integrate ChatGPT as an AI assistant to enrich instruction, reduce teacher workload, update traditional teaching methods, and promote more engaging, student-centered writing classrooms, provided that academic integrity and critical engagement with AI-generated feedback are carefully scaffolded."
