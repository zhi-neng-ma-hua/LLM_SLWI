		"research_aims (研究目的与问题)": "To develop and evaluate the Smart UEnglish mobile app that integrates multiple recognition technologies (image-to-text recognition, speech-to-text recognition) and artificial intelligence to support EFL writing in authentic contexts; to compare learning achievement in EFL writing between an experimental group using recognition technologies plus AI support and a control group using recognition technologies only; to examine correlations between learning behaviors (use of ITR, STR, AI-generated sample sentences, grammar feedback, revisions) and learning achievement; and to explore learners perceptions toward Smart UEnglish.",
		"research_gap_or_novelty (研究创新性与知识空白)": "The study addresses the challenge that EFL learners often lack lexical resources and inspiration for writing and that existing recognition technologies alone (ITR, STR) provide vocabulary but not extended content support. It introduces Smart UEnglish as a novel integration of multiple recognition technologies and generative AI to provide both lexical resources and AI-generated sample sentences for inspiring meaningful writing in authentic contexts, and it empirically examines not only learning achievement but also system log based learning behaviors and learner perceptions."

	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "Six-week quasi-experiment conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic; learners studied at home using the mobile app, with learning activities scheduled inside the app and progress monitored weekly by the teacher through online meetings; pre-test in week 1, two weeks of practice writing, additional practice and monitoring, and post-test in week 5; overall intervention spanned six weeks.",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "Generative AI language model used to generate sample sentences (AI-generated sample sentences, AI-GS); the specific model name or architecture is not reported, though prior related work cited used GPT-2 as an example of generative AI.",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "The generative AI is embedded in the Android Smart UEnglish app as a backend service that takes ITR-generated texts as input and returns AI-generated sample sentences (AI-GS); specific model version, provider, parameter settings, and deployment details are not reported.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "System-embedded generative AI: students interacted with a unified mobile interface (Smart UEnglish) and invoked the AI by tapping the AI-GS button, which automatically sent ITR-generated texts to the AI and displayed returned sample sentences; students did not converse directly with the AI in free-form chat, and the teacher did not mediate AI outputs manually.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "Prompting to the AI was automated: image-to-text recognition (ITR) generated lexical items and phrases related to photos taken by learners, and these ITR-generated texts were used as input for the AI-GS to produce sample sentences; no explicit prompt-engineering strategies (such as few-shot examples, role prompting, or rubric-based prompting) are described.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "After the pre-test, the teacher and researchers trained learners to use Smart UEnglish (for EG) and UEnglish (for CG), including how to use ITR, STR, and AI-GS in four steps (taking photos, generating sample sentences, writing drafts, obtaining grammar feedback); there is no report of explicit training on AI literacy, prompt design, critical evaluation of AI outputs, or academic integrity related to AI-generated text.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "Both groups completed a one-hour pre-test in week 1 within the app. Then the teacher and researchers trained learners to use the respective apps. Over the following weeks, learners practiced EFL writing at home in authentic contexts by describing real objects related to engineering (hardware and software) in their surroundings, following tasks scheduled inside the app. In each practice cycle, learners were guided through four steps in Smart UEnglish: (1) use ITR and STR to capture lexical resources, (2) generate sample sentences via AI-GS based on ITR-generated text, (3) write a short essay draft with four paragraphs using typing and optionally STR as input, and (4) receive grammar feedback (GF) to enhance writing quality and revise their drafts. Learners had to complete tasks in the scheduled week and could not move to later tasks if previous tasks were incomplete or scheduled for a later week. Learners were required to produce at least four essays during practice and submit them to the teacher. The teacher monitored progress and provided weekly online meetings for both groups. In week 5, learners took the one-hour post-test in the app. After the intervention, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 EG learners regarding their perceptions of Smart UEnglish.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "The experimental group (EG, n=33) learned EFL writing using the Smart UEnglish Android app, which integrated ITR, STR, generative AI (AI-GS), and grammar feedback (GF). Learners took photos of authentic objects related to the essay topics around their homes; Smart UEnglish used ITR to recognize photos and produce related vocabulary and phrases (lexical resources). Learners could modify these texts via typing or STR. They then used AI-GS, which took ITR-generated text as input and produced sample sentences to inspire their writing. Learners wrote essays with four paragraphs, using typing and optionally STR as input, and then requested grammar feedback (GF) to receive corrective grammar suggestions and revise their drafts multiple times. All activities were done at home via mobile devices under COVID-19 restrictions, with weekly online monitoring by the teacher.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "The control group (CG, n=38) learned EFL writing using the UEnglish app that included only recognition technologies (ITR and STR) but no generative AI sample sentences; they did not have the AI-GS function. Learners took photos of their surroundings to obtain ITR-generated vocabulary and used STR or typing to input text, then wrote essays based on authentic engineering-related topics following the same schedule and topics as EG. Their writing practice and tasks were managed within the app, and the teacher monitored their weekly progress via online meetings, but their support did not include AI-generated sample sentences or grammar feedback within the app.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "The system supported multiple stages of writing: idea generation and lexical resource activation (via ITR-generated vocabulary and AI-generated sample sentences), drafting (using typing and STR to compose multi-paragraph essays), and revision (using grammar feedback to revise and improve draft quality).",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Short descriptive essays about authentic objects and scenes related to engineering contexts (such as hardware and software in learners surroundings).",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Descriptive writing tasks based on authentic photos: pre-test and post-test required listing vocabulary for a given photo, describing based on that vocabulary, and composing an essay based on three photos; practice tasks required describing real objects surrounding learners at home related to engineering topics.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "The generative AI acted as a sentence generator; it took ITR-generated lexical input and produced AI-generated sample sentences (AI-GS) to inspire learners and model how vocabulary could be composed into sentences before learners wrote their own essays; the AI was not used to score or grade writing.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "A single English teacher with five years of teaching experience taught both groups in an English engineering course, selected topics, coordinated pre-test and post-test, and monitored learners progress once a week via online meetings; the teacher and researchers trained students to use the apps and ensured that learners followed the scheduled tasks, but detailed teacher-provided writing feedback is not described, and the primary feedback for EG during practice came from the app’s grammar feedback and AI-generated sample sentences.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "University engineering faculty; English engineering course; due to COVID-19, learning took place at students homes using the mobile apps, with the teacher monitoring progress through weekly online meetings; the context emphasized authentic home-based environments where learners described real objects around them.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Ethical approval and informed consent procedures are not reported; the study mentions COVID-19 restrictions and home learning but does not explicitly discuss ethics review, consent, confidentiality, or data protection.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Only EG learners had access to the full Smart UEnglish app with AI-generated sample sentences and grammar feedback; CG learners used UEnglish with ITR and STR only. All learners worked within a task schedule embedded in the app, which prevented them from moving to subsequent tasks before completing prior tasks or before the scheduled week. The teacher monitored usage weekly through online meetings, but no specific policy regarding the extent or timing of AI-GS use was reported beyond the app’s functional design.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "Smart UEnglish implemented a content filter for safety to prevent unsafe or harmful content from the AI-generated sample sentences (AI-GS) before displaying them to learners; this is explicitly stated as a mechanism to filter AI-GS outputs; additional safety or bias mitigation measures are not described.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "ANCOVA results showed that, after controlling for pre-test scores, the experimental group using Smart UEnglish with generative AI and grammar feedback significantly outperformed the control group using only recognition technologies on the post-test writing achievement (F=12.37, p<0.01, partial eta squared=0.157; EG adjusted M=30.81 vs CG M=24.92). Within EG, Pearson correlations indicated that total revisions were positively correlated with post-test scores (r=0.359, p=0.040), total use of ITR was positively correlated with post-test scores (r=0.374, p=0.032), total use of AI-GS was positively correlated with post-test scores (r=0.346, p=0.049), and total use of grammar feedback was positively correlated with post-test scores (r=0.346, p=0.049); grammar feedback use was strongly correlated with number of revisions (r=0.843, p<0.01). Stepwise regression identified ITR use as the most influential predictor of post-test performance (R²=0.140, beta=0.374, p=0.032). Interview data from 20 EG learners showed high positive perceptions of Smart UEnglish: students reported that having vocabulary and AI-generated sample sentences inspired them before writing, the interface and tutorials were easy to use, they could conveniently practice and learn new vocabulary on mobile devices, they wished to continue using the app to enhance their writing quality, and they felt physically active and healthy while exploring their surroundings to take pictures."

	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Effectiveness was assessed quantitatively by comparing pre-test and post-test writing scores between EG and CG using ANOVA and ANCOVA with pre-test as covariate and by examining correlations and regression between learning behaviors and post-test scores for EG, and qualitatively by analyzing coded themes from interviews about learners perceptions of Smart UEnglish; results indicated that the AI-augmented Smart UEnglish significantly improved EFL writing achievement compared to recognition technologies alone and that specific learning behaviors (use of ITR, AI-GS, grammar feedback, and revising) were positively associated with better outcomes.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "Pre-test and post-test writing tasks scored using a scoring rubric based on the TOEFL independent writing rubric with three expert raters and intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.890 (pre-test) and 0.799 (post-test).",

		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Pre-test administered in week 1 within the app before any training on Smart UEnglish or UEnglish; post-test administered in week 5 within the app after several weeks of practice; interviews conducted after completion of the intervention; no delayed post-test or follow-up measurements reported.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Post-test writing scores (TOEFL rubric based) with pre-test scores as covariate; for EG only, post-test writing scores as predicted by learning behaviors (ITR use, STR use, AI-GS use, GF use, total revisions, total practice); qualitatively, coded themes representing learners perceptions of Smart UEnglish.",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Instructional condition (Smart UEnglish with recognition technologies plus AI support and grammar feedback vs UEnglish with recognition technologies only) as between-group factor; pre-test writing scores as covariate in ANCOVA; in correlation and regression analyses for EG, behavioral variables (total revisions, total practice, ITR use, STR use, AI-GS use, GF use) as predictors.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "No follow-up; only immediate post-test at approximately week 5 after the start of the 6-week intervention.",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "ANOVA indicated no significant difference between EG and CG in pre-test writing scores (F=0.315, p>0.05). ANCOVA with pre-test as covariate showed a significant difference between groups in post-test writing scores favoring EG (F=12.37, p<0.01, partial eta squared=0.157). In EG, Pearson correlations revealed that total revisions were significantly correlated with post-test scores (r=0.359, p=0.040), total use of ITR was significantly correlated with post-test scores (r=0.374, p=0.032), total use of AI-GS was significantly correlated with post-test scores (r=0.346, p=0.049), and total use of grammar feedback was significantly correlated with post-test scores (r=0.346, p=0.049); total practice was not significantly correlated with post-test scores. Grammar feedback use was strongly correlated with the number of revisions (r=0.843, p<0.01). Stepwise regression showed that ITR use significantly predicted post-test scores (R²=0.140, beta=0.374, t=2.246, p=0.032).",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "ANCOVA partial eta squared for the group effect on post-test writing scores was 0.157, indicating a moderate effect of the Smart UEnglish intervention compared to recognition technologies alone. The regression model with ITR use as the predictor for post-test scores had R²=0.140, suggesting that this behavioral variable explained 14% of the variance in post-test writing achievement within the experimental group.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "No misuse of the AI or negative effects specifically related to generative AI use are reported; learner perceptions toward Smart UEnglish were described as highly positive, and the paper does not discuss risks such as plagiarism, over-reliance on AI, hallucinated content, or bias.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "The study does not report subgroup or equity analyses by gender, proficiency level, or other demographic factors; authors do not discuss differential effects across subgroups.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "The authors note that learning achievement was scored by total scores on the rubric and suggest that future work should use more detailed evaluation criteria to assess writing quality (e.g., content, cohesion, consistency, grammar). They also mention that learners should be encouraged to use STR rather than typing for text input and that future versions of the system could integrate additional recognition technologies such as GPS to provide vocabulary based on learners locations. The study was conducted while learners were at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have affected learning activities and limits generalizability to normal classroom conditions; participants were undergraduates from an engineering faculty at a single university, which constrains generalization.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges and risks include reliance on mobile devices and network connectivity for using multiple recognition technologies and AI in authentic home contexts, the constraint that learning occurred at home during the COVID-19 pandemic rather than in controlled classroom settings, limitations of using total rubric scores without fine-grained evaluation of different aspects of writing, and the need to motivate learners to use speech-to-text input actively instead of defaulting to typing.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future studies should adopt more detailed writing evaluation criteria (e.g., separate dimensions for content, cohesion, consistency, grammar), encourage greater use of speech-to-text recognition, and explore integrating other recognition technologies such as GPS to provide location-based vocabulary. Additional research could investigate Smart UEnglish in classroom settings beyond home learning, extend to other learner populations and contexts, and further refine the app’s mechanisms to support EFL writing in authentic contexts.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study implies that integrating multiple recognition technologies (ITR and STR) with generative AI sample sentences and grammar feedback in a mobile app can effectively support EFL learners in practicing meaningful writing in authentic contexts, improving writing achievement beyond recognition technologies alone. Pedagogically, it suggests that combining context-based lexical input (from ITR), AI-generated model sentences (AI-GS), and iterative grammar feedback fosters richer content, more effective revision behavior, and positive learner perceptions, highlighting the potential of mobile AI-enhanced tools to complement traditional EFL writing instruction, especially when learners write about real-world objects around them."
