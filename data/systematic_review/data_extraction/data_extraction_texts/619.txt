Over 12 weeks, Class A (ChatGPT) wrote narratives based on visual stimuli and submitted them to ChatGPT with the fixed prompt, then used ChatGPT’s error-focused feedback to revise their texts; Class B (Grammarly) wrote similar narratives and submitted them to Grammarly AWE, reviewed automated feedback on linguistic and stylistic errors, and revised accordingly; Class C (Google Translate) wrote narratives first in Hindi, translated them into English themselves, then used Google Translate to produce an additional English version and compared the machine output with their own to revise; Class D (control) practiced writing with a traditional grammar–translation approach without CALL tools. After training, all classes completed a posttest picture-based narrative writing task under the same timing and conditions as the pretest.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Three experimental interventions: Class A used ChatGPT 3.5 to submit picture-based English stories via a fixed prompt and receive categorized error feedback with explanations and examples for revision; Class B used Grammarly’s Automated Writing Evaluation tool to analyze narratives for grammatical and stylistic errors and then revised based on Grammarly’s feedback and reflective discussion; Class C used Google Translate to translate their Hindi stories into English, compared their own translations with Google Translate output, and revised their texts based on differences and perceived accuracy.",

		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "All four classes showed reductions in writing errors from pretest to posttest, with MANOVA indicating a significant main effect of test (pre vs post) and significant interactions among error type, class, and time. ChatGPT (Class A) showed the largest improvements in correcting spelling, verb form, and subject-verb agreement errors; Grammarly (Class B) was most effective for prepositional errors; Google Translate (Class C) produced the largest gains for article use, capitalization, and possessive forms; the control group (Class D) improved most in punctuation. Overall, ChatGPT and Google Translate were characterized as more effective than Grammarly and traditional pedagogy in rectifying a broad range of common writing errors, suggesting that different CALL tools may be optimally suited to different grammatical challenges."
	},
	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Effectiveness was assessed using pre- and post-picture-based narrative writing tasks analyzed by Grammarly’s Automated Essay Scoring system to count eight categories of errors.

		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "MANOVA revealed a significant main effect of error type, F(7,42)=31.580, p<.001, partial η²=.840, indicating that some error types occurred more frequently than others; a significant main effect of class, F(3,46)=18.179, p<.001, partial η²=.542, indicating different overall error levels among classes; and a significant main effect of test, F(1,48)=86.767, p<.001, partial η²=.644, showing a marked reduction in errors from pretest to posttest. The interaction between error type and class was significant, F(21,28)=20.594, p<.001, partial η²=.939, indicating that classes differed in which error types improved most; the interaction between error type and test was also significant, F(7,42)=15.326, p<.001, partial η²=.719, indicating that improvements varied across error types. The class-by-test interaction was not significant, F(3,46)=0.100, p=.960, suggesting similar overall pre–post improvement across classes, but the three-way interaction among error type, class, and test was significant, F(21,28)=2.367, p=.017, partial η²=.640, indicating complex differential effects of each tool on specific error types over time.",

		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "NR",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Limitations include the use of a specific set of classroom settings at a single Indian public school, the selection of only three CALL tools (ChatGPT, Grammarly, Google Translate), potential lack of generalizability to other tools or contexts, and a focus on immediate error correction that may not fully capture long-term learning effects; other potential influencing variables such as learner anxiety, motivation, or individual differences were not directly measured.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Challenges noted include that the selected CALL tools and immediate error-correction focus may not represent all dimensions of technology-enhanced language learning, and that concentrating on short-term improvements in error counts may overlook long-term retention and broader aspects of writing proficiency.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future studies are encouraged to examine a wider range of CALL tools and AI systems, assess their impact over longer periods to capture sustained language competence, test these technologies in diverse learning contexts, and explore effects beyond writing accuracy, including other language skills and long-term development of ESL/EFL learners.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "Findings suggest that integrating CALL tools such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, and Google Translate can substantially support ESL/EFL learners’ grammatical accuracy when used in a targeted way, with different tools being particularly effective for distinct error types; they support using these tools for immediate, individualized feedback in writing classes and encourage teachers to incorporate CALL tools strategically to address specific grammatical challenges and enhance error-awareness and correction in L2 writing."
