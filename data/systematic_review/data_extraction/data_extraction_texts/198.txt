		"theoretical_foundation (理论基础_理论框架)": "Grounded in Hattie and Timperley’s Feedback Model, which distinguishes feed up, feedback, and feed forward across task, process, self regulation, and self levels, and in Self Determination Theory, which highlights the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in motivation; the study frames Generative AI feedback as particularly suited to task level support on lower order language issues and hybrid feedback as better positioned to address process level, self regulation, and motivational aspects that foster higher order writing skills and sustained engagement.",
		"data_collection_instrument (数据收集工具)": "Instrument 1: GRE like argumentative writing assessments simulating the GRE Issue Writing Task, with prompts adapted from course materials and scored using GRE writing rubrics and the 6 Traits Writing Model, covering seven categories (Critical Thinking, Organization, Development, Sentence Variety, Grammar and Mechanics, Voice, and Tone) each rated on a 0–6 scale with 0.5 increments; Instrument 2: a Likert scale questionnaire based on Hattie and Timperley’s feedback model and Self Determination Theory, assessing perceptions of task level, process level, self regulation, and self level feedback as well as intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and amotivation (scale 1–5); Instrument 3: semi structured interviews with ten students exploring how they perceived different feedback types, how they improved writing after feedback, and which feedback they found most beneficial.",
		"data_collection_validity_reliability (工具信度与效度)": "Questionnaire reliability was examined and Cronbach’s alpha for the feedback and motivation questionnaire was reported as 0.97, indicating very high internal consistency; writing assessments were scored by two GRE instructors with a third instructor consulted when score discrepancies exceeded one point to ensure scoring consistency; prompts were adapted from actual GRE materials and scoring used established GRE rubrics and the 6 Traits framework; interview protocols were semi structured and conducted by two researchers, but additional validity indices for interviews and inter rater reliability statistics for scoring beyond the described procedure were not reported.",
		"data_analysis_method (数据分析方法)": "Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS 27; descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, ranges, and frequencies) were computed; due to non normal distributions, within group changes in pre and post writing scores were examined using related samples Wilcoxon signed rank tests; between group differences in post test writing scores across total and trait scores and in questionnaire responses were examined using Mann–Whitney U tests; effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d with Hedges g applied to adjust for small sample size; questionnaire reliability was assessed via Cronbach’s alpha; qualitative data from interviews and feedback content were subjected to thematic analysis to identify recurring themes and patterns in students’ experiences and perceptions of GenAI and hybrid feedback.",

	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "Twelve week GRE preparation course in August 2023 with ten 90 minute writing sessions and six biweekly writing exercises during the course, Generative AI or hybrid feedback after each practice essay, and a 60 minute timed post course writing assessment.",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "ChatGPT based Generative AI, specifically GPT 4 Turbo integrated into a customized feedback system",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "A customized feedback system was built using the Coze platform integrating GPT 4 Turbo with a GRE essay knowledge base; the system provided structured feedback in three components (Holistic Essay Assessment, Detailed Sentence by Sentence Review, and Encouraging Feedback), evaluated essays across dimensions such as critical thinking, organization, development, sentence variety, grammar, voice, and tone, offered specific suggestions and examples for improvement, and was constrained to GRE writing topics; access appears to have been through an online interface, with researchers or students submitting Word documents to the system, but precise API settings, prompt templates, or parameter values are not reported.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Generative AI was embedded in a customized automated writing feedback system used as part of an online GRE writing course; in Group 1 participants submitted their essays and received only GenAI generated feedback directly from the system; in Group 2 participants’ essays were first processed by the same GenAI system and then the AI feedback was reviewed, supplemented, and contextualized by a human tutor before being returned to students, creating a hybrid feedback loop that combines automated and human input.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "The customized Coze based system generated multi component feedback aligned with GRE rubrics and 6 Traits categories, including holistic ratings, sentence level comments, and encouraging remarks, and was guided by an integrated GRE essay knowledge base and constraints on topic scope; however, the article does not provide detailed descriptions of the underlying prompt engineering, few shot examples, or parameter settings used with GPT 4 Turbo.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Participants all took a GRE training course covering verbal reasoning, writing tasks, and quantitative reasoning, but no specific training on AI literacy, interpreting or critiquing GenAI feedback, or prompting strategies is described for this study; the need to develop students’ understanding of GenAI capabilities and limitations is discussed in the implications section rather than implemented as a formal training component.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "All 60 Chinese EFL students enrolled in a 12 week GRE online course with ten 90 minute writing sessions, during which they completed six GRE style argumentative writing exercises; after each exercise, Group 1 participants received immediate structured feedback from the GPT 4 Turbo based system, while Group 2 participants had their essays processed by the same system but then received hybrid feedback where a human tutor reviewed the GenAI output, identified issues such as critical thinking and structural coherence, provided additional tailored explanations and strategies, and offered guidance on future tasks and exam preparation; at the end of the course all participants completed a 60 minute timed GRE argumentative essay under secure conditions for post testing, which was scored by GRE instructors, and then completed questionnaires regarding feedback perceptions and motivation, with a subset of students participating in semi structured interviews.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Hybrid feedback condition (Group 2): participants wrote GRE style argumentative essays, first received structured GenAI feedback generated by the GPT 4 Turbo based system, and then received additional human tutor feedback that built on and refined the AI comments, addressing higher order issues such as critical thinking, organization, depth of development, and coherence, and providing personalized strategies, explanations, and motivational support tailored to each student’s proficiency level and goals.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "GenAI feedback only condition (Group 1): participants wrote the same type of GRE style argumentative essays and after each submission received only the structured feedback from the GPT 4 Turbo based system, including holistic assessment, sentence level comments, and encouraging feedback without further human tutor interpretation or supplementation.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "LLM integration occurred at the feedback and revision stage following essay drafts written during the GRE preparation course, not during initial text generation in the post course timed assessment; feedback was intended to inform students’ subsequent revisions and future writing practice rather than directly edit the final test essays.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "GRE Issue style academic argumentative essays in English",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Timed GRE Issue writing tasks requiring participants to respond to argumentative prompts and compose full essays within 60 minutes for the main assessment and shorter timed tasks for practice during the course.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "The Generative AI system served as an automated writing feedback provider, generating holistic essay evaluations, detailed sentence by sentence comments, and motivational feedback aligned with GRE standards and 6 Traits categories, focusing on aspects such as grammar, sentence variety, vocabulary choice, formality, critical thinking, organization, development, voice, and tone; it did not appear to be used for final scoring of the post test essays, which were assessed by human raters.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "Human tutors, holding master’s degrees in TESOL or English literature, delivered GRE writing instruction and in the hybrid feedback group reviewed GenAI generated feedback, identified issues in critical thinking and structural coherence, added targeted strategies and personalized explanations, gave comprehensive guidance on future tasks and time management, and provided emotional and motivational support that fostered self regulation and confidence; GRE instructors also served as raters for the final writing assessment and a third instructor arbitrated in cases of large scoring discrepancies; in the GenAI only group human involvement in feedback on the practice essays was minimal, limited mainly to course instruction rather than text specific commentary.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "GRE preparation course delivered online by language training institutions serving Chinese EFL students, with all writing practice and feedback occurring in a technology mediated environment and the final 60 minute assessment submitted via a secure online platform.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "The study received ethical clearance from the first author’s university, and participants provided informed consent for data collection and for publication of the manuscript; data availability on reasonable request is noted and a disclosure statement indicates no conflict of interest.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Access to the Generative AI feedback was structured through the customized Coze based system and limited to processing GRE related writing tasks, with constraints imposed to keep feedback focused on GRE topics; during the final writing assessment essays were submitted through a secure online platform with copy and paste disabled and were checked by Turnitin for plagiarism, effectively preventing the use of external AI tools during the test; no further policy details about AI use outside the study tasks are reported.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "The customized GPT 4 Turbo system was constrained to GRE writing topics and informed by a GRE essay knowledge base to maintain relevance and quality, and final assessment essays were checked for plagiarism using Turnitin with copy paste functions disabled on the submission platform; the article does not describe additional safety filters, bias mitigation strategies, or content moderation settings within the Generative AI system.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Generative AI feedback alone significantly improved L2 learners’ lower order writing skills, particularly sentence variety, style, grammar, and vocabulary accuracy, but had limited impact on higher order dimensions such as critical thinking and organizational structure; hybrid feedback combining GenAI and human tutor input produced larger and more balanced gains across all writing traits, with Group 2 showing higher post test means and larger effect sizes than the GenAI only Group 1 in critical thinking and analysis, organization, development and support, sentence variety and style, grammar and mechanics, and voice and tone; Mann–Whitney U analyses confirmed that post test performance in all writing dimensions was significantly higher in the hybrid feedback group than in the GenAI only group; questionnaire data indicated that both groups perceived task level feedback positively but the hybrid feedback group reported significantly higher perceptions of process level, self regulation, and self level feedback as well as higher intrinsic and extrinsic motivation; qualitative findings showed that students in the GenAI only group valued clear and academic AI feedback for grammar and vocabulary but found it less helpful for logical flow, personalized guidance, and motivation, whereas students in the hybrid group appreciated the complementary combination of AI suggestions and tutor explanations that clarified goals, strengthened argumentation, expanded ideas, and offered emotional support; overall, the study concludes that while Generative AI feedback is effective for basic language level aspects, a hybrid feedback model is more beneficial for developing complex academic writing skills and more positive feedback experiences and motivation."
	},
	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Effectiveness of Generative AI and hybrid feedback was evaluated using pre and post GRE like writing assessments rated with GRE rubrics and the 6 Traits Writing Model across seven traits, Likert scale questionnaires on feedback perceptions and motivation based on Hattie and Timperley’s feedback levels and Self Determination Theory, and semi structured interviews exploring learners’ perceptions of feedback utility and motivation.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "GRE writing rubrics combined with the 6 Traits Writing Model, scoring Critical Thinking, Organization, Development, Sentence Variety and Style, Grammar and Mechanics, Voice, and Tone on a 0–6 scale with 0.5 increments for each trait.",
		"writing_performance_focus (写作表现关注维度_流利度_准确性_复杂度_体裁等)": "Focus on both lower order aspects such as sentence variety and style, grammar and mechanics, and surface level language features, and higher order academic writing skills such as critical thinking and analysis, organization and coherence, development and support of arguments, and voice and tone in GRE style argumentative essays.",
		"affective_aspect_measure (情感因素测量工具_问卷_量表等)": "A structured questionnaire using a 1–5 Likert scale to measure perceptions of task level, process level, self regulation, and self level feedback based on Hattie and Timperley’s feedback model and to assess intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and amotivation based on Self Determination Theory, supplemented by semi structured interview questions that probed perceived usefulness and motivational impact of GenAI and hybrid feedback; the questionnaire showed high internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.97.",
		"affective_aspect_focus (情感因素维度_动机_态度_焦虑_自效感等)": "Learners’ perceptions of feedback clarity and usefulness at different levels (task level correctness and grammar corrections, process level guidance on structuring arguments, self regulation level support for independent revision, and self level praise and encouragement) and their motivational states including intrinsic interest in writing, extrinsic motivation linked to fulfilling course or test requirements, and amotivation or feelings that writing is meaningless even after feedback.",
		"cognitive_aspect_measure (认知因素测量工具)": "Cognitive outcomes were primarily inferred from trait scores in Critical Thinking and Analysis, Organization, and Development and Support on the GRE writing assessments, along with thematic analysis of interview data about how students used feedback to refine arguments and structure, rather than from separate standardized cognitive or metacognitive questionnaires.",
		"cognitive_aspect_focus (认知因素维度_策略使用_元认知监控等)": "Emphasis on higher order thinking skills such as critical evaluation of arguments, logical organization of ideas, development and support of claims, and metacognitive regulation of writing based on feedback, particularly how hybrid feedback facilitated more substantial improvements in organization and critical thinking than GenAI feedback alone.",
		"behavioral_aspect_measure (行为因素测量工具_日志_平台日志等)": "Behavioral engagement with feedback was examined indirectly through questionnaire items on self regulation feedback, interview reports about how learners revised their writing in response to AI and human comments, and qualitative analysis of feedback content; no detailed platform usage logs or frequency counts of system interactions were reported.",
		"behavioral_aspect_focus (行为因素维度_使用频率_交互模式_坚持度等)": "Focus on how learners acted on feedback, such as whether they used GenAI suggestions mainly for grammar and vocabulary or also for restructuring texts, how they integrated human tutor guidance into revisions, and how hybrid feedback influenced their willingness to make substantial changes and self regulate their writing process; the hybrid group showed more active engagement in revising arguments and organization according to the qualitative themes.",
		"other_outcomes_measure (其他结果测量工具)": "The same questionnaire provided measures of perceived feedback levels and motivation, and semi structured interviews yielded qualitative insights into perceptions of feed up, feedback, feed forward, and self regulation dimensions; the study also compared effect sizes of GenAI and hybrid feedback with those reported for other AWE tools in prior meta analyses.",
		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "Other outcomes included perceptions of different feedback levels in Hattie and Timperley’s model and their alignment with Self Determination Theory needs, learners’ overall trust in and attitudes toward GenAI and hybrid feedback, and comparative positioning of GenAI and hybrid feedback effect sizes relative to traditional AWE systems such as Pigai, Criterion, and Grammarly and to other feedback modalities such as human tutor only feedback, peer tutoring, and computer mediated corrective feedback.",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Pre writing assessment before the 12 week GRE course and repeated practice essays during the course with feedback, followed by an immediate post writing assessment at the end of the course along with the feedback perception and motivation questionnaire and post course semi structured interviews with a subset of learners; no delayed follow up assessment was conducted.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Primary outcomes were pre to post changes and post test levels in overall writing scores and in seven trait scores (Critical Thinking and Analysis, Organization, Development and Support, Sentence Variety and Style, Grammar and Mechanics, Voice, and Tone), and differences between groups in these scores; secondary outcomes included perceived task level, process level, self regulation, and self level feedback and levels of intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and amotivation.",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "The main independent variable was feedback type, with Group 1 receiving GenAI feedback only and Group 2 receiving hybrid feedback combining GenAI and human tutor input; time (pre vs post assessment) functioned as a within participant factor for each group; no additional experimental factors such as proficiency or discipline were formally modeled.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Both groups showed statistically significant improvements from pre to post writing assessments according to Wilcoxon signed rank tests, with standardized test statistics above 3 and p values reported as less than .001; Group 1 exhibited modest gains while Group 2 showed larger gains; Mann–Whitney U tests indicated statistically significant differences between the hybrid feedback group and the GenAI only group in overall post test writing scores and in all seven writing traits, with p values at or below .001, indicating that hybrid feedback led to significantly better performance; questionnaire analyses using Mann–Whitney U tests found no significant difference between groups for task level feedback perceptions but significant differences for process level, self regulation, and self level feedback, as well as higher motivation in the hybrid group, with reported p values less than .05.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Within group Hedges g effect sizes for pre to post changes showed a moderate overall effect for the GenAI only group (g=0.45) with the largest gain in Sentence Variety and Style (g=0.64) and the smallest in Critical Thinking and Analysis (g=0.25), and large overall effects for the hybrid feedback group (g=1.45) with large effects above 1.35 across all traits including Organization (g=1.62), Critical Thinking and Analysis (g=1.35), Development and Support (g=1.37), Sentence Variety and Style (g=1.44), Grammar and Mechanics (g=1.42), and Voice and Tone (g=1.40); between group comparisons of post test performance yielded Hedges g values around 1.07 for overall scores and above 1.0 for Organization, Development and Support, and Critical Thinking and Analysis, demonstrating strong advantages for hybrid feedback over GenAI feedback alone; the study also notes that the effect size of GenAI feedback on L2 writing was lower than the overall effect size of AWE from prior meta analyses but higher than that of some AWE tools such as Pigai and Criterion and lower than that of Grammarly.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The study highlights several limitations and risks associated with Generative AI feedback: GenAI feedback, while helpful for surface level language improvements, showed limited impact on higher order skills such as critical thinking and organizational structure, raising concerns about its sufficiency for complex academic writing; prior research cited indicates that reliance on ChatGPT can impair creative writing abilities and lead to lower scores in originality and content accuracy and that GenAI tends to produce grammatically sound but superficial and template like content, potentially fostering over dependence on pre structured outputs and discouraging independent thinking and creativity; the article notes that AI generated feedback quality can be inconsistent, particularly for higher quality essays, and that inaccuracies may cause students to internalize incorrect guidance; learners may misinterpret indirect or overly academic AI feedback or find it difficult to understand, which can reduce their willingness to act on it; the need for learners to verify AI feedback when dealing with unfamiliar topics is emphasized, and it is noted that effective use of AI requires AI literacy and critical awareness of its limitations, without which overreliance on AI tools can erode learners’ sense of achievement from autonomous writing and may negatively affect long term motivation.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "The authors discuss in the literature review that Generative AI’s differential impact across various language learning groups, particularly non native English speakers and disadvantaged learners, has been insufficiently studied and that hybrid feedback may help provide more equitable support for learners with limited resources; however, in this study no formal subgroup analyses by gender, discipline, proficiency variation within the TOEFL and IELTS thresholds, or socioeconomic background were conducted, and no disaggregated equity related statistics are reported.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Limitations noted include that the quality and consistency of AI generated feedback depend heavily on prompt design and system customization, which may influence the effectiveness of feedback; the study used only one Generative AI model (GPT 4 Turbo in the Coze environment), so it is unclear whether similar findings would hold for other AI models such as LLaMA; the intervention focused on a relatively short 12 week period with six writing exercises and one post test, limiting conclusions about the long term development of writing skills; the study adopted a specific integrated hybrid feedback model and did not compare alternative hybrid configurations such as parallel or peer assisted hybrid feedback; the sample was restricted to motivated Chinese EFL learners preparing for the GRE, which limits generalizability to other L2 populations and writing contexts; and some analytic details, such as blinding procedures, attrition, and formal baseline equivalence tests, were not reported.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges and risks discussed include the difficulty of ensuring that AI feedback is accurate, comprehensible, and appropriately aligned with learners’ proficiency and task demands, the potential for students to misunderstand or underutilize AI suggestions when they are indirect or not clearly tied to their own arguments, the need for learners to cross check AI generated feedback and information when dealing with unfamiliar topics, the requirement for both teachers and students to develop AI literacy to understand the capabilities and limitations of Generative AI tools, and practical challenges in effectively integrating AI feedback with human feedback so that they complement rather than duplicate or contradict each other, as well as the resource demands of training educators to use and scaffold GenAI tools in ways that support learners’ self regulation and do not foster over reliance.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research directions proposed include investigating the performance, reliability, and educational impact of alternative AI models in generating feedback for argumentative writing, exploring different hybrid feedback configurations such as parallel hybrid feedback where AI and human instructors provide feedback simultaneously and peer assisted hybrid feedback that integrates AI with peer comments, conducting longitudinal studies with delayed post tests to examine the long term effects of GenAI and hybrid feedback on writing development, further integrating feedback source distinctions and skill levels into updated feedback models that combine Hattie and Timperley’s framework with Self Determination Theory, and systematically evaluating interventions aimed at improving feedback literacy, AI literacy, and self regulation skills among L2 writers.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "Theoretically, the findings suggest that Hattie and Timperley’s Feedback Model can be extended by distinguishing between AI and human feedback sources and by explicitly incorporating motivational mediators from Self Determination Theory, with Generative AI positioned as most effective for task level support on lower order skills and hybrid feedback as better suited to process level and self regulation feedback that fosters higher order writing abilities and intrinsic motivation; practically, the study implies that L2 writing instruction can benefit from integrating Generative AI tools for immediate, consistent feedback on grammar and sentence variety while using human tutors to provide deeper guidance on organization, critical thinking, and self regulation and to supply emotional and motivational support; educators are encouraged to design courses where AI feedback handles routine language corrections, freeing human instructors to focus on higher order concerns and coaching students on how to interpret and apply AI suggestions critically, and to provide training and scaffolded activities that help learners build feedback literacy and AI literacy, use AI tools responsibly rather than as a substitute for thinking, and maintain motivation and confidence in their own writing abilities."
