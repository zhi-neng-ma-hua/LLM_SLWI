	"Methodology": {
		"research_design (研究设计_实验_准实验_纵向等)": "Randomized controlled trial with three parallel groups (teacher e-feedback, AI feedback, hybrid feedback) using a pre-test–post-test design, embedded in an explanatory sequential mixed-methods framework where qualitative reflections were collected from the highest-performing (hybrid) group after quantitative analysis.",
		"research_method (研究方法_定量_定性_混合)": "Mixed methods (primary quantitative RCT with ANCOVA and pairwise comparisons; follow-up qualitative thematic analysis of reflection prompts for the hybrid group).",
		"sampling_method (抽样方法)": "From six IELTS writing classes at two branches of a single language center in Shiraz, three classes were randomly selected; these three intact classes were then randomly assigned to one of the three feedback conditions; students were informed and could switch to other classes if they did not wish to participate, resulting in final group sizes of 30, 30, and 28.",
		"sample_size_and_effect (样本量及效应量)": "Total N=88 adult intermediate students distributed across three groups: Group 1 Teacher E-Feedback n=30, Group 2 AI Feedback n=30, Group 3 Hybrid Feedback n=28. OPT homogeneity test: F(2,87)=0.105, p=0.901, indicating no significant initial proficiency differences. ANCOVA for overall writing performance: group effect F(2,84)=14.07, p<.001, partial η²=0.251 (large). For writing components: Task Achievement/Response F(2,84)=4.95, p=0.009, partial η²=0.105; Coherence and Cohesion F(2,84)=4.19, p=0.018, partial η²=0.091; Lexical Resource F(2,84)=7.43, p=0.001, partial η²=0.150; Grammatical Range and Accuracy F(2,84)=3.63, p=0.031, partial η²=0.080. Pairwise comparisons showed the hybrid group significantly outperforming the other groups on overall performance and several components, and the AI group significantly outperforming teacher e-feedback on lexical resource.",
		"theoretical_foundation (理论基础_理论框架)": "Grounded broadly in feedback and hybrid intelligence literature; discussion interprets findings using Krashen’s Affective Filter Hypothesis, dual-process theory (System 1 immediate AI feedback vs System 2 reflective teacher feedback), and notions of AI-supported self-directed learning and scaffolding in EFL writing.",
		"data_collection_instrument (数据收集工具)": "Oxford Placement Test (OPT) for proficiency homogeneity; pre-test and post-test L2 essays (200-word IELTS Task 2-style essay topics from Cambridge Book 3); IELTS Writing Band Descriptors assessing Task Achievement/Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy; open-ended written reflection prompts for the hybrid group to capture perceptions and experiences.",
		"data_collection_validity_reliability (工具信度与效度)": "OPT used to establish initial proficiency homogeneity across groups (ANOVA non-significant). All essays were anonymized and double-scored by two experienced EFL IELTS-writing instructors trained on the IELTS Writing Band Descriptors; weighted Cohen’s Kappa κw=0.85 (p<.001) indicated almost perfect inter-rater agreement, with discrepancies resolved by discussion. Qualitative thematic analysis of reflections was performed independently by two researchers, achieving inter-rater reliability κ=0.82 before resolving disagreements.",
		"data_analysis_method (数据分析方法)": "Descriptive statistics to summarize pre- and post-test writing scores; ANOVA on OPT scores to check group homogeneity; ANCOVA to compare overall writing performance and each writing component across the three feedback groups while controlling for pre-test scores; partial eta-squared used as effect size; pairwise comparisons to locate specific group differences; qualitative thematic analysis of reflection prompts with coding by two raters and reliability via Cohen’s kappa.",

		"power_analysis (功效分析与样本量论证)": "NR",
		"sampling_frame_and_representativeness (抽样框与样本代表性)": "Sampling frame comprised adult intermediate IELTS writing students at two branches of a single private language center in Shiraz, Iran; authors note that the context (one language center and IELTS-focused courses) limits generalizability to broader educational settings and learner populations.",
		"scoring_procedure_and_rater_training (评分流程与评分者培训)": "All pre- and post-test essays were anonymized, assigned random codes, and mixed so that two independent EFL writing instructors (each with more than five years of IELTS writing teaching experience and not involved in the interventions) rated them blindly to group and time point, using the IELTS Writing Band Descriptors; inter-rater agreement was checked on 25% of essays (44 essays) with weighted Cohen’s Kappa κw=0.85, and disagreements were resolved through discussion to reach consensus; the consensus scores were used in analyses."
	},
	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "Two-and-a-half-month semester of regular IELTS writing classes, with pre-test at the start of the semester and post-test at the end; feedback modality (teacher e-feedback, AI-only, hybrid) applied consistently throughout the semester on multiple writing assignments.",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI) and other AI writing assistants such as CoPilot and AI Chat; Non-LLM tool: Grammarly (Premium version).",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "Students accessed web-based AI tools including ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI) and Grammarly Premium via standard user interfaces; no API configuration or specific parameter settings (e.g., temperature) were reported; students used teacher-provided prompt templates to query the AI tools.",

		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "Rubric-aligned prompt templates were provided for the AI group, such as requests to review essays for content expansion and clarity, grammar and syntax errors, vocabulary enhancement, organization and structure, and mechanics; students were trained to formulate clear and specific prompts to obtain feedback aligned with IELTS criteria (Task Achievement/Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range and Accuracy); no advanced prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought or few-shot examples were reported.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "At the beginning of the semester, AI-feedback groups received comprehensive training on the benefits and challenges of AI-assisted writing tools, including how to effectively use ChatGPT-4 and Grammarly, how to write clear prompts, interpret and apply AI-generated feedback on content, grammar, and style, and how to critically evaluate AI suggestions while preserving their own voice; hybrid group students were similarly trained in AI use and in integrating AI feedback with teacher e-feedback.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "After OPT placement and group homogeneity checks, a writing pre-test (200-word IELTS-style essay) was administered to all three groups. During the 2.5-month semester, all groups attended regular IELTS writing classes using the same syllabus. Group 1 received only teacher e-feedback: students wrote drafts for in-class and homework tasks, scanned their papers, and the instructor provided detailed, personalized e-feedback via screen-capture videos created with Snagit and annotated with a Wacom tablet, sent via Telegram, covering content, grammar, vocabulary, and organization according to predefined guidelines. Group 2 received AI feedback as the primary feedback source: after drafting essays, students used ChatGPT-4 and Grammarly Premium, guided by sample prompts, to obtain feedback on content, organization, grammar, vocabulary, and mechanics, then revised their work accordingly; students submitted both original and AI-assisted drafts, and the instructor monitored AI use and offered guidance where AI feedback was insufficient or context-insensitive. Group 3 (Hybrid) used both approved AI assistants (ChatGPT, CoPilot, AI Chat) and teacher e-feedback: students drafted essays, applied AI feedback to revise, submitted both versions, and then received additional screencast-based e-feedback from the instructor focusing on higher-order content and organizational issues and nuanced language use. At semester end, all groups completed a post-test 200-word IELTS-style essay, scored with IELTS band descriptors; only the hybrid group completed reflection prompts about their experiences.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Three experimental conditions were implemented: (1) Teacher E-Feedback group (n=30) received only detailed teacher e-feedback via annotated screencast videos; (2) AI Feedback group (n=30) received feedback primarily from ChatGPT-4 and Grammarly Premium using structured prompts, with the instructor providing limited oversight; (3) Hybrid Feedback group (n=28) combined AI tools (ChatGPT, CoPilot, AI Chat, Grammarly where applicable) with subsequent teacher e-feedback on AI-revised drafts; LLM-specific data derive from the AI Feedback and Hybrid Feedback conditions.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Teacher E-Feedback group served as the non-AI control condition, receiving only teacher electronic feedback created via Snagit screencasts and Wacom tablet annotations on scanned student scripts, focusing on content, grammar and syntax, vocabulary, and organization and structure, without any AI-based feedback.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Idea development and drafting of IELTS Task 2-style essays; reception of feedback (teacher, AI, or both); revision and rewriting based on feedback; pre-test and post-test essays assessed final performance rather than intermediate drafts.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "IELTS Writing Task 2-type argumentative/expository essays (approximately 200 words) drawn from Cambridge Book 3 topics.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Timed or course-based 200-word IELTS Task 2-style essay writing for pre-test and post-test; multiple in-class and homework essay-writing tasks throughout the semester within IELTS writing classes.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "In the AI and Hybrid groups, ChatGPT-4 and related AI assistants acted as interactive feedback providers that reviewed student drafts, suggested content expansions and clarifications, identified and corrected grammar and syntax errors, recommended more varied and context-appropriate vocabulary, commented on organization and cohesion, and flagged mechanical issues; they did not serve as formal graders but as AI writing evaluators and revision aids.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "A single experienced writing instructor taught all three groups, delivering IELTS writing instruction and overseeing adherence to the feedback protocols; in Group 1 and Group 3 the instructor provided detailed e-feedback via screencast videos and digital annotation; in Group 2 and Group 3 the instructor trained students to use AI tools, monitored AI-assisted drafts, and offered additional guidance where AI feedback was generic, context-insensitive, or insufficient for higher-order aspects; the instructor did not provide full parallel manual feedback in the AI-only group, to preserve the integrity of the AI feedback condition.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Two branches of a private language center in Shiraz, Iran, offering face-to-face IELTS writing classes for adult intermediate ESL/EFL learners, supplemented by digital tools (email/Telegram, Snagit screencasts, CamScanner, AI writing tools) for feedback delivery and draft sharing.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Participants were informed about the nature of the study at the beginning of their two-and-a-half-month semester and given the option to change classes if they did not wish to participate; all participants signed paper informed consent forms and participation was voluntary; no explicit reference to an institutional ethics committee approval is reported.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Students in AI and Hybrid groups were explicitly introduced to approved AI tools (ChatGPT-4, Grammarly, CoPilot, AI Chat) and their benefits and challenges; they were instructed to use these tools for revising their own writing and to submit both original and AI-assisted drafts for instructor review; use of AI tools was structured and monitored within course requirements, but no detailed institutional AI policy or explicit prohibition clauses were described.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "No technical safety filters or content moderation settings for ChatGPT-4 or other AI tools were specified; pedagogical safeguards consisted of instructor-led training on critical use of AI, warnings about over-reliance on AI for surface errors, and guidance to preserve personal voice and develop self-editing skills; teacher oversight of AI-assisted drafts aimed to catch misleading or generic AI suggestions.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "ANCOVA controlling for pre-test scores showed a significant main effect of feedback type on overall EFL writing performance, F(2,84)=14.07, p<.001, partial η²=0.251, with the Hybrid Feedback group achieving the highest post-test scores, followed by AI Feedback and Teacher E-Feedback. For Task Achievement/Response and for Coherence and Cohesion, the Hybrid group outperformed the other groups, with partial η²≈0.105 and 0.091 respectively, indicating medium to large effects. For Lexical Resource, AI Feedback significantly outperformed Teacher E-Feedback, and both AI and Hybrid groups showed advantages over teacher-only feedback (F(2,84)=7.43, p=0.001, partial η²=0.150), indicating that AI tools were particularly effective at vocabulary enhancement. For Grammatical Range and Accuracy, the Hybrid group showed the most substantial improvement (F(2,84)=3.63, p=0.031, partial η²=0.080), suggesting that combining AI error-flagging with teacher explanations yields stronger gains than either method alone. Pairwise comparisons indicated that the Hybrid group significantly surpassed both Teacher E-Feedback and AI Feedback on overall performance (mean differences ≈0.31–0.39 bands, p<.001), while AI Feedback significantly exceeded Teacher E-Feedback on Lexical Resource (mean difference ≈0.44 bands, p=0.029). Qualitative findings from the Hybrid group (n=11) indicated predominantly positive experiences (82% reporting engaging and motivating feedback), perceived improvements in structure, vocabulary, and clarity (≈91%), reduced writing anxiety (≈73%), and a universal preference (100%) for the hybrid approach over teacher-only or AI-only feedback, citing the combination of quick, detailed AI corrections with personalized, explanatory teacher comments as especially valuable."

		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Feedback condition with three levels (Teacher E-Feedback, AI Feedback, Hybrid Feedback) as a fixed factor; pre-test writing scores as covariates; no additional independent variables such as gender or age were modeled.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA (no follow-up assessments beyond the immediate post-test at the end of the semester).",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "ANCOVA showed a significant effect of feedback group on overall writing performance after controlling for pre-test scores, F(2,84)=14.07, p<.001. For Task Achievement/Response, group differences were significant, F(2,84)=4.95, p=0.009; for Coherence and Cohesion, F(2,84)=4.19, p=0.018; for Lexical Resource, F(2,84)=7.43, p=0.001; for Grammatical Range and Accuracy, F(2,84)=3.63, p=0.031. Pairwise comparisons showed that the Hybrid Feedback group significantly outperformed the Teacher E-Feedback group and the AI Feedback group on overall writing performance (p<.001). The Hybrid Feedback group also significantly outperformed the Teacher E-Feedback group on Task Achievement/Response and Coherence and Cohesion (p≈0.015–0.023). For Lexical Resource, AI Feedback significantly outperformed Teacher E-Feedback (p=0.029), and Hybrid Feedback significantly outperformed Teacher E-Feedback (p=0.001). For Grammatical Range and Accuracy, Hybrid Feedback significantly outperformed AI Feedback (p=0.026).",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Partial eta-squared for overall writing performance was η²=0.251 (large effect), indicating that about a quarter of the variance in adjusted post-test writing scores was attributable to feedback type. For Task Achievement/Response, η²=0.105 (medium to large); for Coherence and Cohesion, η²=0.091 (medium to large); for Lexical Resource, η²=0.150 (large); and for Grammatical Range and Accuracy, η²=0.080 (medium). These effect sizes suggest that feedback type, particularly hybrid feedback, had practically meaningful impacts on multiple aspects of writing performance, with AI feedback having its strongest unique contribution in lexical development.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The study did not report observed cases of academic misconduct or explicit misuse of ChatGPT-4 or other AI tools, but the literature review and discussion section note concerns that AI feedback systems can encourage over-reliance on technology, potentially reducing self-editing and critical thinking, and that AWE-type systems like Grammarly may provide limited metacognitive explanations and risk overcorrection and cognitive overload. Qualitative results from the hybrid group indicated that some students experienced initial confusion and nervousness when first using the hybrid AI-plus-teacher feedback but reported that this decreased over time as they adapted; overall, students tended to view the AI component positively when combined with teacher feedback rather than as a problematic replacement.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "NR",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Authors note that the sample was drawn from a single private language center in Shiraz, Iran, which limits generalizability to other institutional and cultural contexts; the qualitative component was based on reflection prompts from only 11 of 28 students in the hybrid group (≈39% response rate), which may introduce non-response bias; no control group without any specialized feedback was included, and only three feedback variants were compared; qualitative insights are illustrative rather than generalizable; and the study does not explore longer-term retention or follow-up outcomes beyond the immediate post-test.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Challenges include the complexity of integrating AI feedback with teacher e-feedback in a coherent and non-overwhelming way for students, potential over-reliance on AI for surface-level corrections at the expense of developing self-editing and deeper writing skills, inconsistent timing and synchronization of AI and teacher feedback noted by some students, the need for instructor training to handle lexical feedback and hybrid models effectively, and initial confusion or anxiety among some learners when first engaging with AI-assisted feedback.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research should replicate and extend these findings with larger and more diverse samples across multiple institutions and educational systems, include more balanced qualitative sampling across all feedback groups, and systematically investigate how different AI tools and configurations (e.g., different LLMs or AWE systems) affect specific writing components; further work is suggested on optimizing the timing and integration of AI and teacher feedback, exploring professional development for teachers in hybrid feedback design and lexical scaffolding, and examining long-term effects of hybrid feedback on writing development and learner autonomy.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study suggests that a hybrid feedback model that combines AI tools such as ChatGPT-4 and Grammarly with teacher e-feedback can leverage AI’s rapid, detailed, surface-level corrections and the teacher’s contextualized, higher-order guidance to produce substantial improvements in EFL writing; pedagogically, the authors recommend adopting hybrid feedback models in exam-oriented writing courses, customizing feedback delivery formats (written comments, audio, screencasts) to learner needs, providing clear guidelines and consistent scheduling for AI and teacher feedback, scaffolding students’ use of AI tools through introductory workshops and phased integration, fostering student autonomy and reflection on AI-generated suggestions, and enhancing teacher professional development in lexical scaffolding and feedback design while tailoring AI tool selection (e.g., ChatGPT-4 for content and organization, Grammarly for grammar) to specific writing goals."
