		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "Prompting strategies were learner-driven and varied; students reported using ChatGPT for idea generation and topic exploration, QuillBot for paraphrasing, and tools like DeepSeek or Grok for style and coherence improvement; specific standardized prompts, few-shot examples, or other structured prompt-engineering procedures are not described.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "The methodology does not report formal in-course training on AI literacy, critical evaluation of AI output, or explicit instruction on prompt design; the conclusion and recommendations call for early AI awareness sessions, guided toolkits, and instructor training on AI-supported writing instruction, implying that such structured support was not fully in place at the time of the study.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "Within blended academic English writing courses, students regularly used online platforms such as Edunext, My English Lab, and Google Classroom and increasingly turned to AI tools for writing support. For the paired-writing component, each of 45 volunteers wrote two 200-word essays on the same topic about the benefits and drawbacks of vaccination: one essay was written independently without AI, and one essay was written with AI assistance, where students could draw on tools such as ChatGPT, QuillBot, DeepSeek, Grammarly, or Grok for idea generation, paraphrasing, grammar correction, and style refinement. These paired essays were then scored with IELTS-based descriptors to compare performance with and without AI support.",

		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "Instructors delivered blended academic writing instruction using LMS platforms and face-to-face classes; they did not directly control or embed AI tools within the course but created an environment where students could, and increasingly did, use AI tools for writing tasks; the need for future instructor training in AI-supported writing instruction is discussed, but specific teacher mediation of AI tool use in this study is not detailed.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Higher education setting at FPT University Hanoi; first-year academic English writing courses delivered in a blended format combining in-person instruction with online platforms such as Edunext, My English Lab, and Google Classroom.",

		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Students most frequently used ChatGPT for idea generation, particularly in the prewriting stage, and used tools such as QuillBot, DeepSeek, and Grok more selectively for paraphrasing, style improvement, and revision; self-report data indicate emerging strategic use of AI tools across different writing stages. Quantitative analysis of 45 paired writing samples showed that AI-assisted essays had higher IELTS-based writing scores than essays written without AI, with a mean increase from 5.81 to 6.76 (a gain of 0.94 bands) and 40 of 45 students showing improvement. Survey and interview data revealed that students perceived AI tools as enhancing clarity, confidence, and overall writing quality, and reducing anxiety and effort in writing, while also expressing concerns about potential over-reliance and loss of independent writing practice."

		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "Students expressed concerns about potential over-reliance on AI tools, with some reporting that heavy use of AI made them feel they might not be learning to write independently; the study notes general risks such as reduced critical thinking, diminished engagement in drafting, and possible misuse or plagiarism but does not empirically measure these behaviors.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "The sample is limited to 103 first-year students from a single Vietnamese university, and the authors note limited generalizability, but no specific subgroup analyses by gender, major, proficiency band, or other equity-related variables are reported.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Limitations include the absence of a control group, which restricts attributing improvements solely to AI use; focus on final compositions rather than the dynamic iterative process of student-AI interactions; lack of empirical assessment of AI misuse such as over-reliance or plagiarism; a sample restricted to 103 first-year students at one university and a single writing task type (argumentative essay on vaccination), limiting generalizability; and challenges in fully capturing and verifying the extent of AI influence on students’ work.",
