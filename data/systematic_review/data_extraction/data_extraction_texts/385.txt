Over 20 weeks, three times per week, participants completed topic description writing tasks under identical conditions in a language lab. For each task, the experimental group wrote in Word, then logged into WhatsApp on a laptop and submitted their text to Meta AI, received immediate AI-driven corrective feedback on grammatical errors, revised their text according to AI suggestions, and could ask Meta AI for detailed explanations of each error. The control group wrote the same tasks in Word and then sent their texts via WhatsApp to peers, received peer feedback, used it to revise their work, and then participated in discussions about grammar issues and areas for improvement. This feedback cycle was repeated throughout the 20-week intervention for both groups.",

		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "Meta AI functioned as an AI-driven corrective feedback provider and interactive chatbot within WhatsApp, detecting grammatical and syntactic errors, supplying immediate corrective feedback and explanations, and supporting revision. ChatGPT 4.0 functioned as an automated scoring and analysis tool to identify ten types of grammatical errors and produce writing performance scores for research analysis only (scoring only / no pedagogical intervention).",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "The same instructor taught both classes, provided overall course instruction, administered pretests and posttests, set writing topics and laboratory conditions, and collected files; in the control group, the instructor facilitated peer feedback and grammar discussions, whereas in the experimental group, feedback and explanations were primarily provided by Meta AI; the instructor did not provide direct corrective feedback to the experimental group during the intervention cycles.",

Descriptive results showed that the AI-driven group’s mean score increased from 30.28 at pretest to 39.05 at posttest (gain=9.22), while the control group’s mean score increased from 30.48 to 32.37 (gain=1.89). AI-driven corrective feedback via WhatsApp Meta AI particularly helped learners reduce complex grammatical errors across ten specified error types (subject-verb agreement, tense, pronouns, fragments, run-ons and comma splices, misplaced modifiers, apostrophes, capitalization, word choice/lexical errors, prepositions), demonstrating that AI-enhanced feedback can substantially improve ESL writing accuracy compared to traditional peer feedback."

		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Two-way RM-ANOVA showed a significant main effect of group on writing scores, F(1,55)=16.513, p<.001, indicating that the AI-driven corrective feedback group outperformed the non-AI group; a significant main effect of assessment time, F(1,55)=53.538, p<.001, indicating overall improvement from pretest to posttest; and a significant group-by-assessment interaction, F(1,55)=27.793, p<.001, indicating that the AI-driven group improved significantly more than the control group.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Partial eta squared values were reported: partial η²=.231 for the group main effect (group explains about 23.1% of the variance in scores), partial η²=.493 for the assessment main effect (pretest–posttest differences explain about 49.3% of the variance), and partial η²=.336 for the group-by-assessment interaction (interaction explains about 33.6% of the variance).",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The study does not report misuse of Meta AI or ChatGPT by learners; however, in the discussion the authors acknowledge that some prior studies have raised concerns about the accuracy, consistency, and intelligibility of ChatGPT responses, even though their own findings show strong positive effects of AI-driven feedback; they also note that WhatsApp-based AI feedback might not be feasible in conventional or low-literacy environments, which could limit applicability.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "Authors note that participant demographics and study duration may restrict generalizability but do not report subgroup analyses by gender, proficiency, or other characteristics; no equity-focused statistical analyses are presented.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Reported limitations include that WhatsApp might not function as effectively in conventional or low-literacy environments; participant demographics (non-English-major undergraduates in India aged 20–23) and the 20-week study duration may limit generalizability; and the focus on a single messaging platform and AI integration (Meta AI in WhatsApp) and one language skill (writing grammar) means that findings may not transfer directly to other contexts, learner populations, or language skills.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges include dependence on WhatsApp and device access, which may not be available or usable in all educational contexts; the need for learners to be sufficiently digitally literate to interact with Meta AI via WhatsApp; and possible constraints related to using AI tools in environments where technological or pedagogical norms are more traditional.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "The authors suggest that future research should examine Meta AI-driven WhatsApp corrective feedback in different educational contexts and with varied learner demographics, investigate long-term effects of such interventions on language retention and cognitive development, and explore the use of similar AI-driven feedback mechanisms across broader language skills and contexts.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "Findings support integrating AI-driven corrective feedback systems such as Meta AI in WhatsApp into ESL classrooms to enhance grammatical accuracy and overall writing performance, complementing but not replacing traditional feedback; AI can provide immediate, individualized feedback aligned with Vygotsky’s interactionist and sociocultural principles, operating within learners’ zones of proximal development and transforming everyday digital communication into learning opportunities; the study suggests that AI-enhanced feedback mechanisms can reduce teacher workload on routine error correction and allow more time for higher-order instructional tasks."
