		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "Over a 16-week semester, 274 undergraduate TEFL students in four academic writing classes were randomly allocated to a Gemini-assisted treatment group (n=151) or a traditional control group (n=123). Both groups were taught by the same instructor, followed the same syllabus, used the same course materials, and had the same number of instructional hours. To avoid contamination, treatment and control sessions were conducted separately, and participants were asked not to share intervention-related materials outside class. The only systematic difference was that the treatment group used Gemini as a GenAI writing assistant, while the control group completed writing tasks without GenAI support. Learners in the treatment group were encouraged to use Gemini at different phases of the writing process (brainstorming, drafting, revising, editing) to obtain real-time feedback on grammar, vocabulary, cohesion, coherence, and organization. All participants completed the CATW and L2WAS at three time points (Weeks 1, 8, and 16) under standardized conditions, and data were analyzed via LGCM to model growth in writing proficiency and writing anxiety.",

		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "The same instructor taught both treatment and control groups, delivered the academic writing syllabus, and ensured that both groups used identical materials and had equal contact hours; for the treatment group, the instructor integrated Gemini into classroom practice by encouraging and overseeing its use during writing tasks, while for the control group the instructor provided conventional, non-GenAI-based writing instruction; the instructor also implemented procedural safeguards to minimize contamination between groups.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Four undergraduate academic writing classes in a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) program at a public university in Iran; the precise mode of delivery (fully face-to-face, online, or blended) was not specified, but classes were held separately by condition within the same institution.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "The study reports that all procedures were in accordance with institutional and/or national research ethics standards and the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments; students were informed about the purpose and scope of the research, assured that participation was voluntary and could be withdrawn without academic penalty, and written informed consent to participate was obtained from all participants.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Access to Gemini was restricted to the treatment group; to minimize contamination, instructional sessions for treatment and control groups were run separately, and participants were instructed not to share intervention materials or discuss the Gemini-assisted activities outside of class; broader institutional policies on GenAI use (e.g., academic integrity rules) were not described.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "NR (the article does not report specific technical safety measures or content filtering settings for Gemini beyond describing it as a nonjudgmental, responsive tool).",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "LGCM results showed that the Gemini-assisted treatment group experienced significant growth in writing proficiency and a significant reduction in writing anxiety over the 16-week course, whereas the traditional control group did not show statistically significant change in these constructs; in the treatment group, the mean writing proficiency slope was MD≈4.49 (SE=0.181, CR=24.84, p<.001) and the mean anxiety slope was MD≈−5.42 (SE=0.114, CR=47.48, p<.001), indicating continuous improvement in writing and continuous reduction in anxiety across the three measurement points; a significant negative covariance between writing and anxiety slopes (standardized r≈−0.156, p<.001) suggested that learners who improved more in writing proficiency tended to show larger decreases in writing anxiety; model fit indices (RMSEA=0.067, CFI=0.953, TLI=0.947, SRMR=0.069) indicated acceptable model fit; overall, GenAI-assisted instruction using Gemini was found to substantially enhance L2 writing proficiency and alleviate writing-related anxiety compared to traditional instruction."

		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "No major learning-related negative effects of Gemini are reported; the article emphasizes substantial improvements in writing proficiency and reductions in anxiety in the treatment group; potential limitations such as variability in Gemini’s performance depending on task complexity and learner proficiency are mentioned, but issues such as plagiarism, over-reliance, or explicit misuse of GenAI are not discussed in detail.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "The study notes substantial individual variability in intercepts and slopes for writing and anxiety and suggests that differences may relate to proficiency levels, psycho-affective attributes, and degree of engagement, but it does not report formal subgroup analyses by gender, proficiency band, or other demographic factors; equity-focused outcomes and subgroup-specific statistics were not provided.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "The study was conducted in a single institutional context (one public university in Iran) with TEFL undergraduates, limiting generalizability to other settings, disciplines, and cultural contexts; it relied solely on quantitative data (LGCM of CATW and L2WAS scores) without qualitative methods such as interviews or think-aloud protocols that might provide deeper insight into learners’ experiences; only one GenAI platform (Gemini) was investigated, so findings may not transfer to other GenAI tools; baseline equivalence between groups was not fully detailed beyond random assignment; and no post-course delayed follow-up was included to assess long-term retention.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation considerations mentioned include the need to prevent contamination between treatment and control groups (addressed by holding separate instructional sessions and instructing students not to share intervention-related materials) and the general need for pedagogical approaches that flexibly accommodate individual differences in developmental trajectories; the study also notes that reliance on a single institutional context and one GenAI tool constrains broader application, and it implicitly highlights the need to align GenAI integration with ethical and pedagogical guidelines.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research is recommended to replicate the study across diverse educational contexts and cultural settings to examine cross-cultural applicability; to incorporate qualitative methods (e.g., interviews, learner diaries, think-aloud protocols) to gain deeper insight into cognitive and affective processes underlying observed trajectories; and to conduct comparative studies evaluating multiple GenAI tools (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude) to understand how different GenAI features influence L2 writing development and writing anxiety; additional work is also suggested to explore how learner variables such as proficiency, self-efficacy, and engagement interact with GenAI use.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "Theoretically, the study extends sociocultural theory by illustrating how GenAI tools like Gemini can function as mediational resources and more knowledgeable others within learners’ zones of proximal development, shaping both cognitive (writing proficiency) and affective (anxiety) dimensions of L2 learning; practically, it suggests that L2 teachers can leverage Gemini to provide personalized, real-time feedback on grammar, vocabulary, and structure, integrate GenAI tools throughout the writing process (from brainstorming to revision), and create low-pressure, nonjudgmental environments that reduce writing anxiety; implications for curriculum designers include embedding GenAI-supported writing tasks systematically in L2 writing programs and ensuring that GenAI use is aligned with instructional goals and ethical guidelines so that technology serves as scaffolding rather than a substitute for learning."
