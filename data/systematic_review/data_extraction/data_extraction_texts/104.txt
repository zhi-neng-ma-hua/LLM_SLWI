		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "A structured set of 10 prompts per session targeted IMMs and was used identically in both experimental groups; example prompts included asking which verbs indicate hedges, requesting example sentences for hedges and boosters, asking for common forms of attitude markers, requesting a paragraph including IMMs, and asking the chatbot to determine IMMs in a given paragraph; prompts served to elicit definitions, examples, and paragraph-level realizations of IMMs and to support identification and use in learners’ own writing.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Before treatment, participants were briefed on the study objectives and expectations; the first two sessions in the experimental groups provided explicit training on how to use ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot as writing assistants, including accessing the tools, navigating interfaces, and using them to receive feedback on IMMs and on argumentative writing; design followed recommendations to train students before implementing digital tools in educational settings; explicit training on academic integrity or plagiarism in relation to AI outputs was not reported.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "After MTELP screening and IMMs pretest, 90 eligible advanced learners were randomly assigned to three groups. All groups received printed materials on introductory concepts of IMMs and their subcategories. In the ChatGPT group, learners were trained to use ChatGPT, then in each of six instructional sessions they responded to 10 IMMs prompts via ChatGPT, received AI-generated explanations, examples, and feedback, and wrote or revised paragraphs focusing on IMMs. In the Microsoft Copilot group, learners were trained to use Microsoft Copilot and followed the same sequence of 10 IMMs prompts per session, drafting, editing, and enhancing paragraphs with Copilot’s real-time suggestions regarding IMMs. The control group received conventional instruction: they studied IMMs using printed texts and identified IMMs in reading passages with teacher guidance, without AI tools. In the final session, all groups completed a posttest consisting of two TOEFL iBT argumentative paragraphs in which they were expected to employ IMMs.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "ChatGPT group: training on ChatGPT use followed by six sessions in which learners used ChatGPT to respond to 10 IMMs-related prompts per session, obtain definitions, examples, and identification of IMMs, and receive real-time feedback on their IMMs use in argumentative paragraphs. Microsoft Copilot group: training on Microsoft Copilot use followed by the same six prompt-based sessions, with learners using Copilot for drafting, editing, and improving IMMs in their writing via context-sensitive suggestions and corrections. Both experimental groups shared 15 internet-connected PCs (one for two participants) and worked with identical IMMs prompts and topics, differing only in the AI chatbot used.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Control group received conventional instruction without AI tools: learners used printed materials on IMMs, read passages, and identified IMMs with the help of the instructor; feedback on IMMs was delivered by the teacher in subsequent sessions rather than in real time.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Pretest focused on analysis of existing texts (identifying IMMs); during treatment, experimental groups engaged in drafting and revising argumentative paragraphs with real-time feedback on IMMs from ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot; the control group practiced IMMs mainly at the analysis and identification stage in reading, and later in producing argumentative paragraphs for the posttest; posttest required autonomous production of argumentative paragraphs incorporating IMMs.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Argumentative writing (TOEFL iBT-style argumentative paragraphs).",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Two argumentative paragraphs (each no more than 250 words) on TOEFL iBT topics such as whether dogs should be allowed in restaurants and stores and whether schools should give students money to invest in their futures.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot functioned as interactive AI writing assistants that answered IMMs-related prompts, provided definitions and examples for hedges, boosters, attitude markers, self-mentions, and engagement markers, identified IMMs in sample texts, and gave immediate, contextually relevant suggestions and corrections on learners’ own paragraphs to help them realize IMMs in argumentative writing; they were not used for scoring or grading.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "The second researcher acted as instructor for all three groups; the instructor introduced IMMs and their subcategories, provided initial training on using ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot in the experimental groups, supplied printed materials across groups, guided conventional IMMs identification practice in the control group, administered pretests and posttests, and facilitated the learning process; direct teacher feedback on learners’ IMMs use during experimental sessions was not described in detail, as AI chatbots were the primary feedback providers in the experimental groups.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Academic Center for Education, Culture, and Research (ACECR) in Ardabil, Iran; face-to-face instruction in a computer-equipped classroom with internet-connected PCs supporting AI chatbot access; adult advanced EFL learners in a non-degree academic center context.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Participants were briefed on the study’s purpose, procedures, potential risks, and benefits, could ask questions, and provided voluntary informed consent before participation; confidentiality was maintained via secure data storage and restricted access; the researchers adhered to academic integrity standards, avoided plagiarism and data fabrication, treated participants with respect and cultural sensitivity, and considered potential frustration or anxiety arising from using AI-driven brainstorming or feedback tools against anticipated benefits.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Experimental groups had access to ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot via shared PCs during scheduled sessions; prompts and tasks were teacher-assigned, and both groups used the same IMMs prompts; prior use of ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot for writing improvement was an exclusion criterion (none had such prior use); the control group did not use AI chatbots as part of instruction.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "The article does not report specific technical safety guardrails, content filters, or institutional AI use policies for ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot beyond researcher supervision and classroom use; no explicit mechanisms for preventing inappropriate content or managing AI hallucinations are described.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "After controlling for pretest IMMs performance, ANCOVA showed a significant group effect on posttest IMMs realization in argumentative writing (F(2,86) ≈ 22.23, p < .001, partial η² ≈ .34). Microsoft Copilot group achieved the highest posttest scores (M ≈ 16.40, SD ≈ 2.58), significantly outperforming both the ChatGPT group (M ≈ 12.70, SD ≈ 2.52) and the control group (M ≈ 13.10, SD ≈ 2.45). ChatGPT group did not differ significantly from the control group. Qualitative interview findings indicated generally positive learner perceptions of both AI tools, with stronger satisfaction for Microsoft Copilot: learners highlighted Copilot’s clear, detailed, and contextually rich feedback, its help in generating appropriate IMMs in sentences and paragraphs, and its support for understanding and applying hedges, boosters, attitude markers, self-mentions, and engagement markers. ChatGPT was viewed as helpful but often less comprehensive and less accurate in detecting IMMs, with some learners reporting incomplete lists, misunderstandings, or inaccurate IMMs identification. Some participants noted that Microsoft Copilot could promote dependency on the tool, while others appreciated its motivational and collaborative aspects. Overall, Microsoft Copilot-based instruction was more effective than both ChatGPT-based instruction and conventional instruction for enhancing IMMs use in argumentative writing."

		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "Interview data revealed several concerns and negative aspects: some learners in the ChatGPT group reported that the chatbot’s responses on IMMs were incomplete, lacked sufficient explanations, sometimes misunderstood prompts, and failed to accurately identify IMMs in paragraphs, leading to confusion and suggesting it was not a fully reliable detector; some learners in the Microsoft Copilot group noted the risk of promoting dependency on the tool and mentioned that long explanations could become boring; certain codes highlighted that ChatGPT might reduce attention to markers and not provide a complete concept for attitude markers or engagement markers; overall, learners and authors acknowledged the potential for overreliance on AI tools in writing, underscoring the need for careful pedagogical integration.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "NR (no subgroup analyses by gender, age, L1, or other demographic factors, and no explicit equity-related analyses were reported).",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "The study acknowledges several limitations: relatively small and homogeneous sample (N = 90 advanced EFL learners, all L1 Turkish, from a single center in Iran), limiting generalizability; absence of a delayed posttest to assess retention of IMMs learning; focus exclusively on interactional metadiscourse markers without examining the broader metadiscourse system; participants were all advanced learners, so effects at lower proficiency levels remain unknown; qualitative perceptions were collected only via semi-structured interviews with a subset of experimental group learners, and methods such as think-aloud protocols were suggested for deeper insight; real-world classroom dynamics and long-term integration of AI tools were not investigated.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges and risks discussed include the need to provide explicit training for learners before using AI tools in instruction, potential overreliance on AI chatbots such as Microsoft Copilot for IMMs realization, limitations of ChatGPT’s accuracy and completeness in detecting and explaining IMMs, the risk that learners may pay less attention to metadiscourse markers if feedback is not sufficiently focused, and the requirement for teachers to learn how to effectively integrate AI-generated feedback with conventional instruction while addressing ethical and pedagogical concerns.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "The authors recommend future research with larger and more diverse samples across different educational settings and proficiency levels; inclusion of delayed posttests to examine long-term retention of IMMs; extension of focus from IMMs to broader interactive metadiscourse; use of additional qualitative methods such as think-aloud protocols to deepen understanding of learners’ interactions with AI tools; comparative work on different AI platforms and update cycles to clarify model-specific strengths; and exploration of practical implementation strategies to sustain positive effects of AI-assisted feedback in real-world classrooms.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "Findings imply that AI-powered chatbots, particularly Microsoft Copilot, can serve as effective formative feedback tools for enhancing EFL learners’ use of interactional metadiscourse markers in argumentative writing; integrating such tools into writing curricula may improve learners’ awareness and deployment of hedges, boosters, attitude markers, self-mentions, and engagement markers. The study supports feedback theory by showing that immediate, specific, and contextually relevant feedback via AI can substantially benefit writing development. Pedagogically, teachers are encouraged to adopt AI tools as supplements to, not replacements for, traditional instruction; to provide training on effective and responsible AI use; to design tasks that leverage AI strengths in real-time feedback while guarding against dependency; and to use AI-generated feedback to foster learner autonomy, critical evaluation of AI suggestions, and more nuanced academic writing."
