	},
	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "15-week Data Description writing CLIL course with weekly writing assignments; AI-assisted feedback via ChatGPT used across six teacher-assessed assignments; the survey was administered at the end of what is described as a 13-week course.",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "ChatGPT (OpenAI, large language model)",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "Students used ChatGPT as an online AI writing assistant through a fixed prompt per assignment that specified evaluation criteria (content accuracy, grammar, spelling); the specific ChatGPT version, access modality (web interface vs app), and parameter settings were not reported.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students interacted directly with ChatGPT outside of class (and sometimes during class) by submitting their drafts to the tool and receiving criteria-based feedback; ChatGPT was not embedded in the LMS and teachers did not intermediate or rewrite the AI output before students saw it.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "For each weekly assignment, students received a specific, teacher-designed prompt to input into ChatGPT, which included detailed criteria focusing on content accuracy and linguistic aspects (grammar and spelling); the prompt requested two types of feedback, one on content criteria and one on linguistic accuracy; all students used the same prompt per assignment, but the exact wording of the prompt is not reported and no advanced prompting techniques (such as few-shot examples or chain-of-thought) are described.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Students were instructed on how to interpret and apply ChatGPT's feedback, including understanding the distinction between content-related and language-related comments and strategies for revising their drafts based on this feedback; however, there is no detailed description of explicit training in broader AI literacy, prompt construction, or ethical use beyond general literature-based discussion.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "Each week students wrote a composition on a business-related data topic integrating course content and language skills, maintained a writing journal in which they recorded drafts, AI feedback, and revisions, and used a teacher-provided prompt to submit their drafts to ChatGPT. ChatGPT delivered feedback on whether content criteria were met and highlighted grammar and spelling issues, sometimes with direct corrections, explanations, or indications of error locations. Students then revised their drafts based on this AI feedback and submitted a polished final version for teacher assessment. In parallel, they received pre-class oral feedback on common mistakes, in-class real-time corrective feedback on shared writing samples using a 7-point rubric, and post-assignment written feedback accompanying their grades. The AI-assisted feedback thus functioned as an extra layer of language training supplementing in-class instruction.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Single cohort intervention in which all participating students used ChatGPT to receive criteria-based feedback on weekly Data Description writing assignments, revised their drafts according to the AI feedback, and submitted final versions that were graded by the teacher.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "NA",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "AI-assisted feedback was used during the revision and editing stage between initial drafts and final submissions, helping students to identify and correct grammar and spelling errors and to check alignment with content criteria before submitting their final compositions.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Short academic business-related Data Description and analysis texts on topics such as dealership sales inventory, diversity and inclusion in organizational structures, Real Effective Exchange Rate as an importation factor, social media use for brand awareness, franchising expansion, and professional talent attraction strategies.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Weekly CLIL writing assignments requiring description and explanation of business-related quantitative or conceptual data, written compositions submitted first as drafts for AI feedback and then as revised final versions for teacher assessment; tasks were designed to become progressively more challenging over the course.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "ChatGPT acted primarily as a writing feedback provider, automatically detecting and flagging grammar and spelling mistakes, commenting on whether content criteria were met, and offering suggestions or explanations for improvement; it did not assign scores or grades but served as an AI-assisted revision tool to support linguistic accuracy and content clarity.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "The instructor designed the CLIL Data Description writing curriculum and assignments, created and provided the criteria-based prompts used with ChatGPT, delivered pre-class oral feedback on common errors, offered in-class real-time corrective feedback on selected student texts using a 7-point rubric, and supplied post-assignment written feedback and grades; the AI feedback was explicitly positioned as an additional support layer to compensate for limited in-class language training time.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "University-level CLIL Data Description writing course in the Business Administration Faculty at a major university, delivered in face-to-face classes with support from information and communication technologies; students used ChatGPT outside class and occasionally during class to receive AI-assisted feedback on writing.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "NR",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Students were expected to use ChatGPT to obtain feedback on their writing assignments and revise their drafts prior to final submission; a survey at the end of the course measured how frequently they used ChatGPT to read feedback, for other writing-related purposes, and during class; the study discusses ethical concerns such as plagiarism and over-reliance on AI but does not report a detailed institutional policy or explicit rules beyond integrating AI feedback as a support for language learning.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "No specific technical safety settings, content filters, or monitoring mechanisms for ChatGPT are described; the article notes general concerns about reliability, ethical use, plagiarism, and algorithmic bias and stresses the need for refining AI feedback mechanisms and maintaining a balance between AI assistance and traditional teaching methods.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Students reported generally positive perceptions of AI-assisted feedback: around 86.5% found ChatGPT helpful or very helpful for improving grammar, 95.3% for spelling, and 84.9% for meeting content evaluation criteria; high correction rates were observed for AI-identified errors, with roughly four-fifths of grammar and spelling mistakes in drafts corrected in final submissions, suggesting that ChatGPT feedback supports linguistic accuracy and self-regulated revision. Students valued the immediacy of feedback and its support for clarity, structure, and error identification, but many also experienced difficulties understanding complex or ambiguous AI comments and noted that some suggestions were incorrect or irrelevant. Concerns included over-reliance on AI, potential reduction in critical thinking and problem-solving, and occasional conflicts between AI and teacher feedback. The study concludes that ChatGPT can effectively support writing development in CLIL contexts when used as a supplementary tool but that AI feedback mechanisms need refinement to improve clarity, relevance, and alignment with pedagogical goals."
