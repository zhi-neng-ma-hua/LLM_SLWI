Point biserial correlations examined associations between feedback condition and outcome variables. Pearson product moment correlations were used to assess relationships between emotions, motivation, engagement, and score improvements. Simple linear regression analyses were conducted separately for each group to examine the predictive effects of motivation and engagement on score improvements. An alpha level of .05 was used. Qualitative interview transcripts were analyzed with Leximancer using unsupervised thematic analysis to identify recurrent concepts and themes and to generate concept maps and co occurrence structures.",

		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "Student essays in the feedback group were submitted by the researcher to GPT 3.5 turbo with a prompt that included the task instructions, learning objectives, and a request for no more than 500 words of feedback; the article does not specify whether the web interface or an API was used or provide model parameter settings such as temperature or top p.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Teacher mediated integration; students had no direct interaction with the LLM during the task. The researcher collected students’ original essays, submitted them to GPT 3.5 turbo, received written feedback, and emailed this AI generated feedback to students in the feedback group before the revision phase; the LLM was not used for text generation by students, nor for automated scoring.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "A single structured prompt was used by the researcher for the feedback group, describing the argumentative essay task and learning objectives and instructing GPT 3.5 to provide written feedback on the student essay of up to 500 words; no use of advanced prompting strategies such as multi step prompting, few shot examples, or rubric based prompting was reported.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Students were explicitly prevented from using generative AI during the writing task and did not interact directly with the LLM; no explicit training was provided on how to interpret or critically evaluate AI feedback, how to design prompts, or on broader LLM literacy and academic integrity issues related to AI use.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "In a two hour computer laboratory session under test conditions, all students wrote a 30 minute argumentative essay in English on a set topic without access to generative AI; a researcher supervised to prevent plagiarism and AI use. Students then emailed their essays to the researcher. For the feedback group, the researcher submitted essays to GPT 3.5 turbo with a standardized prompt and obtained AI generated feedback, which was emailed back to the students. All students were then asked to revise and improve their papers; feedback group students received and read their AI feedback before revising, while control group students were asked to revise without any feedback. Students had 5 minutes to read feedback or instructions and 20 minutes to revise and resubmit their essays. After resubmission, all students completed a short questionnaire on their emotions, motivation, and engagement during revision. Following each experimental session, one student from the feedback group was interviewed in depth about their experience.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Students wrote an initial timed argumentative essay with no AI support, then received individualized AI generated written feedback from GPT 3.5 turbo summarizing strengths and weaknesses and suggesting improvements, and finally revised their essay within 20 minutes using this feedback as guidance.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Students wrote the same initial timed argumentative essay and were then instructed by email to revise and improve their papers in a comparable time frame but received no AI generated or teacher generated feedback before revising; their revision was based solely on their own judgment.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "The LLM intervention targeted the revision stage of writing only; the original essay drafting was done without AI and the AI feedback was provided between the initial draft and the revised draft to inform editing and rewriting.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Argumentative essay",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Timed argumentative essay under test conditions in response to a single prompt: whether children under five ought to be prohibited from using tablet computers or smartphones, requiring specific reasons and examples.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "GPT 3.5 turbo generated formative written feedback on students’ original essays, including comments and suggestions intended to help them improve the content, arguments, and organization of their writing; the LLM did not generate text to be directly inserted into student essays and was not used for automated scoring or grading.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "Instructors and the researcher designed and administered the writing task under exam like conditions, prevented students from using generative AI during the initial drafting, collected and emailed student work, mediated the submission of essays to GPT 3.5 and distribution of AI feedback to the feedback group, and manually graded both original and revised essays; instructors did not provide additional human written feedback during the experimental session.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "On campus computer laboratory at a Hong Kong university, within a foundational university writing skills course and first year English language course; face to face supervised test conditions.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "The study followed the British Educational Research Association’s ethical guidelines; participation was voluntary, students were fully informed of their right to withdraw at any time, and data were anonymized by replacing names with codes during marking and transcription. The authors stated that ethics committee approval was not required because no personal information was collected, and they reflected on their positionality and power relations in relation to the students.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "During the writing task a researcher monitored the session to prevent students from using generative AI to compose their essays; only the researcher was permitted to interact with GPT 3.5 to generate feedback for the feedback group. LLM use was restricted to producing feedback between drafts and was not allowed for composing or revising text directly during the assessment.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "No explicit technical safety or content filtering configurations for GPT 3.5 were reported beyond the procedural safeguard that all AI interactions were mediated by the researcher and that students were not allowed direct access to generative AI during the assessment.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Compared with students who revised without feedback, those who received GPT 3.5 based feedback showed statistically significantly greater improvements from original to revised essay scores, with a mean improvement of 7.59 points versus 4.47 points and a between group difference of about 3.11 points (p≈0.0036). The point biserial correlation between receiving AI feedback and score improvement was positive but small (r≈0.208). The feedback group also reported higher mean motivation and engagement during revision than the control group, with mean motivation about 1.70 points higher and mean engagement about 0.98 points higher on a 1 10 scale; both differences were statistically significant (motivation p≈0.00004, engagement p≈0.0346), whereas the difference in positive emotion ratings (about 0.79 points higher) was not statistically significant (p≈0.0611). Across all participants, correlations between affective and performance variables were strong, especially for motivation and engagement (r≈0.88 for both with score improvements) and moderate for positive emotion (r≈0.54). Regression analyses showed that motivation and engagement explained a large proportion of variance in score improvements in both groups, with slightly higher R squared values in the feedback group. Interview data revealed that students generally perceived the AI feedback as useful, targeted, and helpful in indicating what to improve and where to focus revision, often describing it as providing a roadmap or a second pair of eyes, though emotional reactions were mixed, with some students finding AI feedback impersonal or less satisfying than human feedback. Overall the study concludes that LLM generated feedback modestly but significantly enhances revision outcomes and may do so partly by increasing motivation and engagement during the revision task."

	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Effectiveness of the AI supported intervention was evaluated by comparing manually graded original and revised essay scores between AI feedback and no feedback groups, and by analyzing post task questionnaire ratings of positive emotion, motivation, and engagement as well as qualitative interview themes. Students receiving GPT 3.5 feedback showed significantly larger score gains and reported higher motivation and engagement, and interviews indicated that many perceived the feedback as helpful and motivating despite some reservations.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "Course writing scores assigned by instructors to the original and revised argumentative essays using the course’s writing assessment rubric; scores were numerical (means around the mid 50s and low 60s), double marked by separate instructors, with the average used as the final score; detailed rubric descriptors and scale anchors were not reported.",
		"writing_performance_focus (写作表现关注维度_流利度_准确性_复杂度_体裁等)": "Overall quality of the argumentative essay as judged by course instructors, including aspects such as the strength and clarity of arguments, organization and structure, and language use; specific analytic dimensions and weighting were not reported.",
		"affective_aspect_measure (情感因素测量工具_问卷_量表等)": "Post task questionnaire with three scalar items asking students to rate, on a 1 to 10 scale, how positive their emotions were during revision, how motivated they were to complete revisions, and how engaged they were with the revision process.",
		"affective_aspect_focus (情感因素维度_动机_态度_焦虑_自效感等)": "Self reported positive emotions experienced during revision, motivation to revise the essay, and engagement with the revision task; the study particularly emphasizes motivation and engagement as key affective correlates of improvement.",

		"behavioral_aspect_measure (行为因素测量工具_日志_平台日志等)": "Same post task questionnaire item on engagement during the revision process, rated on a 1 to 10 scale, was used as a proxy indicator of behavioral engagement with the revision task; no behavioral logs or usage traces were collected.",
		"behavioral_aspect_focus (行为因素维度_使用频率_交互模式_坚持度等)": "Self reported engagement with the revision process, including willingness to revise and perceived involvement in working on improvements during the allotted time.",
		"other_outcomes_measure (其他结果测量工具)": "Semi structured interviews with 16 students from the feedback group, approximately one hour each, audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed with Leximancer to identify themes and concept maps.",
		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "Students’ perceptions of the usefulness and relevance of LLM generated feedback, their emotional and motivational responses to receiving AI feedback, comparisons between AI and human feedback, and perceived impact of the feedback on their revision strategies and confidence.",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Original essay written in a 30 minute timed session; revision completed about 5 25 minutes later (5 minutes to read instructions or feedback plus 20 minutes for revision) in the same two hour lesson; post task questionnaire completed immediately after the revision; interviews conducted shortly after the experimental sessions.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Difference between revised and original essay scores (improvement score); post task positive emotion rating; post task motivation rating; post task engagement rating; qualitatively, central interview themes related to feedback, task, motivation, and perceived improvement.",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Main manipulated independent variable was condition (AI feedback vs no feedback). Additional predictors in correlational and regression analyses included positive emotion, motivation, and engagement scores as continuous variables; gender was recorded but not analyzed as a factor in reported results.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA (no delayed follow up; all assessments occurred within a single two hour session and immediate post task period).",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Independent samples t tests showed that the AI feedback group had significantly greater improvement between original and revised essays than the control group (mean difference in improvement ≈3.11 points, t(192)=2.947, p≈0.0036). Differences in positive emotion ratings between feedback and control groups approached but did not reach significance (p≈0.0611), whereas differences in motivation (mean difference ≈1.70 points, p≈0.00004) and engagement (mean difference ≈0.98 points, p≈0.0346) were statistically significant. Point biserial correlations indicated weak but positive associations between receiving AI feedback and improvement (r≈0.208), positive emotion (r≈0.135), engagement (r≈0.152), and motivation (r≈0.29). Pearson correlations across all participants revealed a moderate positive correlation between positive emotion and score improvement (r≈0.543, highly significant) and very strong positive correlations between motivation and improvement (r≈0.882) and between engagement and improvement (r≈0.883), both with p values effectively near zero. Linear regression analyses showed that motivation explained around 70.1 percent of the variance in score improvements in the control group (R≈0.842) and 83.0 percent in the feedback group (R≈0.911), while engagement explained about 76.2 percent in the control group (R≈0.873) and 79.0 percent in the feedback group (R≈0.889), with all F statistics highly significant.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "The point biserial correlation between AI feedback condition and score improvement was approximately r=0.208, indicating a small effect of AI feedback on improvement. Correlations between condition and motivational or engagement variables were also small (r≈0.29 for motivation, r≈0.152 for engagement). In contrast, correlations between motivation and score improvement and between engagement and improvement were very strong (r≈0.88), and regression R squared values indicated that motivation and engagement individually accounted for roughly 70 83 percent of the variance in score improvements within groups, suggesting large effect sizes for these affective predictors.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The study did not report misuse of the LLM such as plagiarism or overreliance since students were prevented from using generative AI directly; however, interview data revealed some negative affective responses to AI feedback. Several students described AI feedback as impersonal, detached, and less engaging than human feedback, stating that it left them feeling somewhat disengaged or uncomfortable and that it felt strange to receive instructions from an AI. Some students indicated that although they believed the feedback improved their performance, they still did not like getting guidance from an AI compared to a human instructor. No fairness, bias, or factual error issues in the AI feedback were systematically analyzed or reported.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "The sample composition in terms of gender (55 percent female, 45 percent male) was described, and control group composition was said to be representative of this ratio, but no subgroup analyses by gender, proficiency, or other demographic variables were reported and equity or fairness issues related to LLM feedback were not explicitly discussed.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "The study was conducted in a single Hong Kong university with first year language students and a single argumentative essay prompt, limiting generalizability to other contexts, disciplines, and assessment types. The writing task was not credit bearing and took place in a tightly controlled experimental setting, so it is unclear how well the observed effects would transfer to real world course assessments or extended writing tasks. There was no pre feedback questionnaire, so changes in motivation, engagement, and emotions from before to after receiving AI feedback could not be directly assessed. The design did not allow evaluation of the accuracy, depth, or domain specificity of the AI feedback, and the task was general rather than subject specific, leaving open questions about how LLM feedback functions in more discipline specific writing. Effects of potential confounding variables such as prior attitudes toward AI, baseline motivation, and prior writing ability were not modeled, and the partial use of the large sample for some statistical analyses (df=192) was not fully explained.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Challenges include mixed emotional reactions to AI feedback, with some students feeling disengaged, uninspired, or uneasy about receiving guidance from an impersonal system, which may limit affective benefits in some cases; the possibility that AI feedback cycles could be emotionally exhausting or demotivating for certain students; difficulty disentangling whether observed score gains stem from the substantive quality of AI feedback or from the mere presence of feedback and perceived task purpose; and uncertainty about how well these short term effects in a single session would persist or interact with complex course structures and grading practices in authentic settings.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research should compare AI and instructor feedback more directly in terms of accuracy, relevance, and impact on performance and affect, and investigate pre intervention attitudes toward AI to see how they shape subsequent emotions, motivation, and engagement. Longitudinal studies in real course settings are needed to examine sustained use of LLM feedback and its effects over time, including domain specific writing tasks and disciplinary contexts. Further work could analyze the content of AI feedback in detail to identify which aspects most influence performance, investigate how personalization and different prompting strategies affect students’ emotional and motivational responses, and explore how AI feedback can be integrated with human feedback to optimize support while addressing students’ concerns.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The findings suggest that LLM based feedback, when carefully integrated, can modestly but significantly enhance students’ revision outcomes and can support higher motivation and engagement during writing revisions, indicating that generative AI has potential as a scalable feedback tool in large university writing classes. At the same time, the mixed emotional responses and students’ preference in many cases for human feedback underscore the need for hybrid models where AI feedback supplements but does not replace instructor feedback, and where educators attend to students’ affective experiences and provide guidance on interpreting and using AI generated feedback effectively."
