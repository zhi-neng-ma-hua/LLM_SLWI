	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "One academic semester with 90-minute class sessions held twice weekly; research timeline included pretest in Week 4, immediate posttests in Weeks 9 and 13, and delayed posttest in Week 15; ChatGPT integration occurred throughout the semester according to group condition.",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "ChatGPT (latest version at the time; specific model version not reported)",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "Students accessed ChatGPT using their own devices (primarily laptops or tablets, some smartphones), interacting via the standard ChatGPT interface; prompts were primarily in English, with occasional Korean prompts; no formal logging system or detailed API parameters were reported, and different cohorts likely interacted with different underlying ChatGPT versions across semesters.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Direct student use of ChatGPT in class and, for the Free group, outside class: Restricted group was instructed not to use ChatGPT at all; Guided group used ChatGPT only during structured, supervised in-class activities under detailed teacher-provided guidelines; Free group had unrestricted, autonomous access in and out of class across all writing stages, with minimal teacher guidance on ChatGPT usage.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "Guided group used ChatGPT following teacher-designed handouts and explicit prompts for tasks such as generating counterarguments, exploring examples, and providing feedback during pre-writing and post-writing stages; activities required students to use ChatGPT to obtain ideas and then independently develop their own responses. Free group received no formal prompt training and was told to figure out how to use ChatGPT on their own, using it flexibly during brainstorming, outlining, composing, and editing. Restricted group did not use ChatGPT by design.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Guided group received structured support on how to integrate ChatGPT into writing tasks via detailed in-class handouts, supervised tasks, and guidelines that framed ChatGPT as a tool for exploring counterarguments and enhancing essays; editing handouts in post-writing also required students to document original sentences, ChatGPT-corrected sentences, and revised versions, and to analyze error types, thereby fostering reflective use of AI feedback. Free group received no explicit training or instruction on how to use ChatGPT, but was encouraged to use it autonomously and to document corrections and revisions on editing handouts; Restricted group received no LLM training and was explicitly prohibited from using ChatGPT.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "All groups followed the same course sequence: learning paragraph writing, then essays, then various essay types (descriptive, cause and effect, argumentative, problem-solving). Pre-writing included instructor-facilitated topic discussions to explore viewpoints and organize ideas. Restricted group engaged only in face-to-face peer and instructor interaction; Guided group used ChatGPT in structured ways during pre-writing and post-writing tasks under strict guidelines and only in class; Free group had unrestricted ChatGPT use across brainstorming, outlining, composing, and editing both in and outside class. Immediate posttests (Weeks 9 and 13) were 50-minute timed essays with specified prompts; for these, Restricted and Guided groups were not allowed to use ChatGPT or external resources, while the Free group was allowed and encouraged to fully use ChatGPT. Post-writing editing tasks used handouts for all groups, but Guided and Free groups could involve ChatGPT according to their condition. In Week 15, a delayed posttest was administered with no external resources (including ChatGPT) allowed for any group.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "AI-assisted conditions: Guided group had structured, teacher-scaffolded ChatGPT use limited to supervised in-class activities (e.g., generating counterarguments, exploring examples, receiving feedback) alongside peer collaboration and instructor support; Free group had unrestricted, autonomous ChatGPT access during all writing phases (pre-writing, drafting, revising) both in and outside class, used to brainstorm ideas, tackle difficult points, obtain feedback, and correct language without explicit guidance on prompts.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Restricted group had no access to ChatGPT by design; students interacted only with peers and the instructor, engaged in topic discussions, wrote essays, and used editing handouts with peer and teacher feedback; the instructor attempted to prevent ChatGPT use by monitoring and deducting points when unauthorized use was detected.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Pre-writing (topic discussion, idea generation, counterargument exploration), drafting (in-class essay writing), and post-writing (editing and revision); ChatGPT was integrated for Guided and Free groups at pre-writing and post-writing stages, and for the Free group also during composing.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Academic English essays, including descriptive, cause-and-effect, argumentative, and problem-solving essays.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Timed in-class academic essay writing (50-minute tests) on prompts such as factors contributing to individual success, challenges faced by university students and solutions, and group membership versus leadership; additional in-class essays and writing activities as part of course work.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "ChatGPT functioned as a generative AI tool to support L2 writing by providing ideas, counterarguments, examples, suggestions for revision, and feedback on grammar, vocabulary, and expressions; it was used as a conversational assistant for brainstorming and editing but was not used for formal scoring or grading.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "One instructor taught all three groups and provided content instruction on essay writing, facilitated pre-writing discussions, summarized key points on the board, organized peer interaction, designed and implemented guided ChatGPT activities for the Guided group, monitored AI use and enforced restrictions in the Restricted group, and created editing and reflective handouts. The instructor also graded or co-scored essays using the rubric and provided qualitative reflections via interview; in the Free group, the instructor adopted a more hands-off approach to language use, allowing students to manage ChatGPT independently.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Face-to-face university classes in general English academic writing at a university near Seoul, South Korea; instruction, materials, and assignments were conducted entirely in English; students used their own digital devices in the physical classroom to access ChatGPT.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "All participants were informed of the study’s purpose and procedures before data collection; written informed consent was obtained; participation was voluntary; no additional ethics board details are reported.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Restricted group was instructed not to use ChatGPT at any time and was monitored, with point deductions if caught; Guided group could use ChatGPT only during designated in-class activities under strict guidelines and not outside class; Free group had unrestricted ChatGPT access in class and outside class throughout the semester. During posttests, external resources including ChatGPT were prohibited for Restricted and Guided groups but allowed for the Free group on immediate posttests; for the delayed posttest, all groups were prohibited from using external resources including ChatGPT.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "No specific technical safety filters, content moderation settings, or institutional guardrails for ChatGPT use were reported beyond instructor monitoring and usage rules; concerns about potential overdependence, fairness, and unmonitored out-of-class use were discussed but not addressed via technical safeguards.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Pretest writing scores did not differ significantly across groups, indicating similar baseline proficiency. Both AI-assisted groups (Guided and Free) significantly outperformed the Restricted group on immediate and delayed posttest total scores after controlling for pretest performance. The Free group, which could use ChatGPT during immediate posttests, achieved the highest immediate total scores, followed by the Guided group, then the Restricted group. However, analyses of rubric categories showed a more nuanced pattern: in both immediate and delayed posttests, the Guided group significantly outperformed both the Free and Restricted groups on content scores, while the Free and Restricted groups did not differ significantly in content. For organization and language use, both Guided and Free groups significantly outperformed the Restricted group, with no significant difference between the Guided and Free groups. These patterns suggest that structured, teacher-guided ChatGPT use is particularly beneficial for developing and sustaining essay content, whereas more autonomous use can effectively support organization and language form. The instructor interview revealed practical and ethical challenges: difficulty policing ChatGPT use in the Restricted group, perceptions that lower-proficiency students without AI support were disadvantaged, high stress from graded in-class essays in Restricted and Guided groups, and greater comfort and engagement in the Free group where ChatGPT use was allowed and in-class essays were ungraded. The instructor advocated for a hybrid approach that combines structured AI-guided content work with more autonomous AI-supported practice in organization and language use, and questioned the feasibility and desirability of strict bans on AI in modern classrooms."

	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Effectiveness of ChatGPT integration was evaluated primarily through analytic essay scores on pretest, two immediate posttests, and a delayed posttest using a standardized rubric for content, organization, and language use (0–5 each; total 15). ANCOVAs controlling for pretest showed that both Guided and Free AI use conditions improved immediate and delayed posttest writing performance relative to a Restricted no-AI condition. Structured ChatGPT use (Guided group) yielded particularly strong and sustained gains in content quality, while autonomous use (Free group) supported comparable improvements in organization and language use. Instructor interview data provided qualitative evidence on student engagement, stress, and strategic AI use, reinforcing quantitative findings that thoughtful AI integration can enhance L2 academic writing.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "Analytic essay scoring rubric (Kim et al., 2023) with three categories—content, organization, language use—each rated from 0 (no credit) to 5 (excellent), for a maximum total score of 15 per essay; timed 50-minute essay tasks served as performance assessments at pretest, immediate posttests, and delayed posttest.",
		"writing_performance_focus (写作表现关注维度_流利度_准确性_复杂度_体裁等)": "Content quality (topic relevance, clarity and development of explanations and arguments); organization (structural clarity, coherence, and logical flow of ideas); language use (grammatical accuracy, syntactic variety, and vocabulary appropriateness) in L2 academic English essays.",
		"affective_aspect_measure (情感因素测量工具_问卷_量表等)": "Semi-structured instructor interview capturing the instructor’s perceptions of student engagement, stress, and comfort levels across Restricted, Guided, and Free groups; no student self-report affective scales were used.",
		"affective_aspect_focus (情感因素维度_动机_态度_焦虑_自效感等)": "Perceived student engagement and enjoyment of structured in-class AI activities in the Guided group; perceived stress and tension associated with graded in-class essays in both Restricted and Guided groups; perceived sense of ease, autonomy, and enthusiasm for ungraded in-class writing and free ChatGPT use in the Free group; instructor’s concern that restricting AI may frustrate lower-proficiency learners and that relaxed AI policies may better align with learners’ needs and reduce anxiety.",
		"cognitive_aspect_measure (认知因素测量工具)": "Analytic rubric content scores were used as an indicator of idea development and depth of argumentation; instructor interview qualitatively addressed cognitive engagement with content (e.g., rebutting counterarguments, elaborating ideas) under different AI conditions; no separate cognitive strategy or metacognitive monitoring scales were administered.",
		"cognitive_aspect_focus (认知因素维度_策略使用_元认知监控等)": "Depth of content development and argumentation in essays as influenced by structured versus autonomous AI-supported pre-writing and editing tasks; instructor’s observations that Guided group activities, which required using ChatGPT to explore counterarguments and then independently constructing responses, fostered deeper engagement with ideas and consideration of alternative perspectives, whereas Free group students may have relied more on AI-generated content and engaged less in deep idea generation.",
		"behavioral_aspect_measure (行为因素测量工具_日志_平台日志等)": "No direct behavioral log data (e.g., usage logs or interaction counts) were collected for ChatGPT; behavioral engagement was inferred from essay production across multiple timed tests and from qualitative instructor observations of classroom behavior and AI use patterns in each group.",
		"behavioral_aspect_focus (行为因素维度_使用频率_交互模式_坚持度等)": "Level of participation in in-class writing, peer discussions, and AI-supported tasks; observed patterns of ChatGPT use in Guided and Free groups (e.g., using AI to tackle difficult points, consult for corrections, and revisit feedback) versus non-use and occasional unauthorized use in the Restricted group; instructor-reported burden of policing AI usage and perception that Free group students engaged actively with ungraded in-class writing and AI support.",
		"other_outcomes_measure (其他结果测量工具)": "Semi-structured instructor interview used to obtain qualitative insights into perceived differences in engagement, quality of AI use, fairness concerns, and instructional workload across conditions.",
		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "Instructor’s evolving teaching philosophy and practical strategies for AI integration; reflections on fairness of restricting AI for some students, classroom management challenges, and potential benefits of hybrid approaches that combine structured AI use for content with autonomous AI support for language and organization.",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Pretest in Week 4; immediate posttest 1 in Week 9 (after pre-writing discussion and instruction); immediate posttest 2 in Week 13 (after further instruction and pre-writing discussion); delayed posttest in Week 15, with no ChatGPT or external resources allowed for any group.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Total essay scores (0–15) and rubric sub-scores for content, organization, and language use on immediate and delayed posttests, with pretest scores serving as covariates.",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Instructional condition with three levels of AI integration (Restricted: no ChatGPT; Guided: teacher-guided in-class ChatGPT use only; Free: unrestricted ChatGPT access) as the main between-subject factor; pretest essay scores as covariate; rubric categories (content, organization, language use) analyzed as separate dependent variables in additional ANCOVAs.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "Short-term follow-up within the same semester via a delayed posttest in Week 15 after immediate posttests in Weeks 9 and 13; delayed posttest administered under standardized no-AI conditions to assess retention and transfer of writing development.",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Pretest ANOVA showed no significant differences among groups (F=0.79, p=.46). ANCOVA for immediate posttest total scores revealed a significant treatment effect (F(2,99)=34.02, p<.001) and a significant covariate effect of pretest (F(1,99)=21.75, p<.001). Bonferroni post hoc tests indicated that the Free group scored significantly higher than both Guided and Restricted groups (p<.001), and the Guided group scored significantly higher than the Restricted group (p<.001). ANCOVAs for immediate content, organization, and language use scores all showed significant treatment effects (ps<.001). For content, the Guided group significantly outperformed both Free and Restricted groups (ps<.001), while Free and Restricted did not differ significantly (p=.09). For organization and language use, both Free and Guided groups significantly outperformed Restricted (ps<.001), with no significant differences between Free and Guided (ps>.05). For delayed posttest total scores, ANCOVA showed a significant treatment effect (F(2,99)=21.08, p<.001) and pretest effect (F(1,99)=37.17, p<.001); Guided and Free groups both significantly outperformed Restricted (ps<.001), but did not differ significantly from each other (p=.60). Category-specific delayed ANCOVAs mirrored immediate patterns: Guided group significantly outperformed both Free and Restricted in content (ps<.001), while Free and Restricted did not differ significantly (p=.09); for organization and language use, Free and Guided groups both scored significantly higher than Restricted (ps<.001), with no significant difference between Free and Guided (ps>.05).",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Pretest ANOVA showed a small effect size (η2=0.02). For immediate posttest total scores, treatment had a large effect (partial η2=0.407) and pretest had a moderate to large effect (partial η2=0.180). For immediate rubric categories, treatment effects were large: content partial η2=0.278, organization partial η2=0.311, language use partial η2=0.296, with pretest explaining additional variance (partial η2≈0.135–0.146). For delayed posttest total scores, treatment effect remained large (partial η2=0.299) and pretest effect was also large (partial η2=0.273). These effect sizes indicate that varying levels of ChatGPT integration, especially guided and free use, accounted for a substantial proportion of variance in both immediate and sustained L2 writing performance beyond baseline ability.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The instructor reported difficulty preventing unauthorized ChatGPT use in the Restricted group, needing to constantly monitor students and deduct points when violations were detected, which raised fairness concerns for those who followed the rules; she noted that lower-proficiency students in the Restricted group may have been particularly disadvantaged without AI support. The authors discuss broader risks from the literature, such as overdependence on AI tools, procrastination, and potential negative impacts on academic performance when students rely heavily on ChatGPT. The Discussion suggests that Free group students’ lower content scores, despite high overall scores, may indicate that unstructured AI use can reduce motivation to engage in deeper thinking and content development. The study also notes the limitation of unmonitored ChatGPT use outside class, which may lead to inconsistent or problematic reliance on AI that was not tracked.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "No formal quantitative subgroup analyses (e.g., by gender, proficiency band, SES) were conducted. However, the instructor observed that banning ChatGPT in the Restricted group might have unfairly disadvantaged lower-proficiency students who could have benefited from AI support to at least produce some writing, while others might have broken the rules and gained advantages. She also pointed out that strictly policing AI use was taxing and potentially inequitable, and expressed doubts about the effectiveness of restricting AI in the modern era. The authors highlight these fairness and access concerns as practical considerations but do not present detailed subgroup statistics.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Key limitations include: high immediate posttest scores in the Free group likely inflated by open ChatGPT access, complicating interpretation of learning effects; the Restricted group received no AI intervention, making it hard to disentangle specific effects of ChatGPT from more general effects of any additional support; ChatGPT use outside class was not monitored, so out-of-class exposure may have varied across and within groups; the three groups were taught sequentially from Spring 2023 to Spring 2024, meaning each group interacted with potentially different ChatGPT versions as the tool evolved; sample consisted of low to mid-intermediate L2-English learners at one Korean university, limiting generalizability and leaving open how results might differ with advanced learners or other populations; assignment of intact classes to conditions without randomization introduces potential cohort and temporal confounds; only the instructor’s perspective was systematically collected qualitatively, so student perspectives on AI use and engagement are not directly represented.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges included enforcing a no-AI policy in the Restricted group, which required constant monitoring and punitive point deductions and was described by the instructor as extremely taxing and potentially unfair; managing student stress and tension associated with graded in-class essays in Restricted and Guided groups; lack of tracking mechanisms for ChatGPT use outside class in Guided and Free groups, making it difficult to isolate in-class effects; accommodating the evolving nature of ChatGPT across semesters, which meant that cohorts experienced different AI capabilities; and balancing the need for structured guidance in AI use with the desire to promote autonomy and reduce instructor workload.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research should examine alternative instructional designs for free AI use that better capture educational impact while controlling for inflated test scores; explore comparison conditions that provide some form of non-AI support to avoid no-treatment control limitations; incorporate mechanisms such as usage logs or self-reported diaries to track out-of-class ChatGPT use; systematically account for and study the impact of changing AI versions; investigate how different proficiency levels and prior AI familiarity moderate the effects of guided versus free AI integration; include student perspectives alongside instructor perspectives to better understand learner experiences, ethics, and preferences; and further refine hybrid models that combine structured AI support for content with more autonomous AI use for organization and language.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study implies that effective L2 writing instruction with generative AI depends not only on whether AI is used but on how it is integrated within a socially situated writing community. Guided ChatGPT use aligned with the Writer(s) Within Community framework can scaffold deeper content development and sustained improvement, while freer AI use can efficiently support organization and language without heavy teacher oversight. Pedagogically, this suggests that instructors may prioritize structured AI-supported tasks for idea generation and argumentation, and allow more autonomous AI use for linguistic polishing, thereby reducing instructional burden while maintaining learning quality. The findings also suggest that strict bans on AI may be impractical and inequitable, and that educators should instead design transparent, scaffolded AI-use policies that promote engagement, autonomy, and critical evaluation of AI-generated content, integrating AI as a tool that supports rather than replaces human learning processes."
