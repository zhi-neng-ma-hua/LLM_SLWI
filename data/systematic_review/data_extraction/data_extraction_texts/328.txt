		"sample_size_and_effect (样本量及效应量)": "Total N=60 Chinese EFL undergraduates; Group A non-visualised feedback N=30, Group B visualised feedback N=30. Writing scores (IELTS criteria) improved from pre- to post-test in both groups, with Group B showing greater gains, especially in coherence and cohesion. Mixed-ANOVA partial eta squared values for time effects were large across writing scores (for example, coherence and cohesion time effect η²ₚ≈0.63; average score time effect η²ₚ≈0.68). Group effects were small-to-moderate (for example, coherence and cohesion group effect η²ₚ≈0.11; average score group effect η²ₚ≈0.09). For emotions, time effects were moderate to large (for example, enjoyment time effect η²ₚ≈0.58; willingness to write time effect η²ₚ≈0.34; anxiety time effect η²ₚ≈0.28). Group effects were small-to-moderate for anxiety (η²ₚ≈0.08) and boredom (η²ₚ≈0.09), favouring the visualised group. Post-test cognitive load was lower in the visualised group than in the non-visualised group, t(58)=2.847, p=0.006, Cohen’s d≈0.88 (medium-to-large effect).",
		"theoretical_foundation (理论基础_理论框架)": "Cognitive Load Theory (CLT); Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML); Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning with Media (CATLM) as the central framework; research on emotional design and multimedia learning; literature on EFL emotions (foreign language anxiety, boredom, enjoyment, confidence) and motivation; studies on GenAI-supported EFL writing and human-computer interaction.",
		"data_collection_instrument (数据收集工具)": "Self-developed GenAI-powered IELTS writing chatbot (two versions differing only in feedback visualisation) with functions such as Grade, Outline Builder, Synonym Maps, Fix Grammar and Natural for fluency; 300-word timed IELTS Academic Writing Task 2 style argumentative essay as writing task; chatbot-generated pre-score and post-score for writing (task response, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, grammatical accuracy, average); pre- and post-surveys including five-point Likert scales for willingness to write (5 items adapted from Rafiee and Abbasian-Naghneh, 2020), foreign language writing enjoyment (5 items), anxiety (8 items), boredom (4 items) and confidence (4 items) adapted from MacIntyre et al., 1998, Wang and Wang, 2024 and Wang et al., 2025; post-survey scales for cognitive load (5 items), perceived teacher-likeness (5 items) and satisfaction (items adapted from Li and Wang, 2024; Tram et al., 2024; Huang and Zou, 2024).",
		"data_collection_validity_reliability (工具信度与效度)": "To evaluate the reliability of the GenAI chatbot scoring, two experienced IELTS writing instructors independently rated 60 writing samples on the four official IELTS writing dimensions. Inter-rater reliability between the two human raters was excellent with ICC(2,1) values ranging from 0.809 to 0.896. Comparing the average human ratings with AI-generated scores also yielded high agreement with ICC values between 0.858 and 0.961, indicating strong consistency between human and AI scoring. Questionnaire items were adapted from established instruments in the literature, but internal consistency coefficients (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha) for the present sample were not reported.",
		"data_analysis_method (数据分析方法)": "Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations) and normality checks (skewness and kurtosis within |3| and |8|; Q–Q and P–P plots) were conducted using SPSS. For revision scores, willingness to write and foreign language writing emotions, mixed ANOVAs (2 time × 2 group) were conducted in RStudio to test main effects of time, group, and their interaction; when interaction effects were non-significant, post hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction and pairwise comparisons by group within each time point were used; when interaction effects were significant, full pairwise comparisons (group × time) were used. For post-only variables cognitive load, teacher-likeness and satisfaction, independent samples t-tests compared the two groups. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients were used to assess scoring reliability.",
		"unit_of_analysis (分析单位)": "Individual student as the primary unit for survey scores and pre-/post-test writing scores; individual essays as units for scoring and chatbot feedback analysis.",

		"scoring_procedure_and_rater_training (评分流程与评分者培训)": "The chatbot’s Grade function was developed and trained on official IELTS writing samples representing each band level, aligning its scoring with the four IELTS criteria (task response, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy). For validation, two experienced IELTS writing instructors independently rated 60 student essays using the official IELTS writing rubric; their ratings were used to compute ICC values both between human raters and between AI and human averages, confirming high agreement. The main pre- and post-test scores used in the analyses were the chatbot-generated IELTS band scores transformed into an average score. Formal rater training procedures beyond using the official rubric and experience were not described."
	},
	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "Single lab-based experimental session per participant including pre-survey, training video, pre-test essay writing and initial chatbot scoring, one cycle of GenAI-assisted revision, post-test chatbot scoring, and post-survey; only one round of revision was implemented (no longitudinal follow-up).",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "Self-developed IELTS writing chatbot powered by a large language model (Generative AI); specific LLM provider and version NR.",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "The chatbot was implemented with a large language model and hypertext markup language in a web-based interface with a writing section on the left and interactive feedback on the right. Two versions shared identical underlying model settings and interaction logic; they differed only in feedback presentation (plain text versus visualised with colour, tables, bold text and mind maps). The Grade function was trained on official IELTS writing samples for each band level to generate band-aligned scores and targeted feedback. The system automatically logged student essays and scores via a Save Data function. Specific LLM engine, API details and parameter settings (e.g., temperature) were not reported.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students interacted directly with the GenAI IELTS writing chatbot through a web-based interface in computer labs; there was no teacher mediation of the chatbot responses during the experiment, although the chatbot’s feedback logic was derived from prior analysis of human teacher feedback.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "The system used predefined function buttons corresponding to structured prompts (Grade, Outline Builder, Synonym Maps, Fix Grammar, Natural etc.) that emulated experienced IELTS teachers revision workflows. Students wrote their essay in the interface and then invoked these functions step by step as instructed, rather than engaging in free-form prompt engineering; the chatbot then returned automated scoring and feedback aligned with IELTS criteria, highlighting errors and suggesting revisions in either plain text or visually enhanced forms depending on group. Specific textual formulations of internal prompts were not reported.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Before writing, participants watched a training video that introduced the chatbot’s functions, usage steps and important considerations. They were encouraged to ask questions about any unclear aspects of the chatbot operation before starting the task. No explicit training was reported on broader AI literacy, critical evaluation of AI output or independent prompt design beyond using the provided interface functions.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "The experiment was conducted in two computer labs with different chatbot versions. After entering the lab, participants first signed an informed consent form and completed a pre-survey on background and writing emotions. They then watched a training video explaining the chatbot functions and procedure and asked any questions. Next, they wrote a timed approximately 300-word IELTS Writing Task 2 style argumentative essay in the chatbot interface and clicked the Grade button, which generated an initial IELTS-style banded assessment and feedback; this score was recorded as the pre-score. Following a prescribed flow, participants used the chatbot’s functions step by step (such as outline building, grammar correction, synonym suggestions, fluency and coherence guidance) to revise their essays. After revision, they clicked Grade again to obtain a post-score for the revised essay, which was recorded as the post-score. Finally, they completed a post-survey including the same emotion scales (adapted for the GenAI-feedback context) and additional items on cognitive load, teacher-likeness and satisfaction.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Group B (visualised feedback, N=30) used the GenAI IELTS writing chatbot that provided feedback with visual enhancements aligned with CATLM positive emotional design principles. Feedback included colour-coded highlights (for example, red for errors, blue and green for suggested corrections and improved forms), bold text, strikethroughs, mind maps for structure, and tabular formatting to clarify revision suggestions and outline organisation. The visualised interface aimed to support revision at both sentence and discourse level, particularly coherence and cohesion, while reducing cognitive load and eliciting positive emotional responses.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Group A (non-visualised feedback, N=30) used a version of the same GenAI IELTS writing chatbot in which feedback was presented in plain text without additional visual elements. The functions (Grade, Outline Builder, Synonym Maps, Fix Grammar, Natural) and underlying revision logic were the same as in the visualised version, but output resembled typical text-only GenAI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini without colour, tables or visual structuring.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Timed drafting of an argumentative essay (initial composition), followed by GenAI-assisted revision of the draft based on automated scoring and feedback, culminating in a revised version scored by the chatbot; focus on the revision and editing stage rather than initial idea generation.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Timed argumentative essay modelled on IELTS Academic Writing Task 2.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Approximately 300-word timed argumentative essay completed within the experimental session as part of English for Academic Purposes writing practice.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "The large language model acted as an automated IELTS writing tutor and evaluator: providing band-aligned scoring, automated written feedback on task response, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource and grammatical accuracy; highlighting errors; suggesting corrections and synonyms; generating outlines and fluency/coherence improvements; and presenting feedback in either plain text or visually enhanced formats. It served as both a scorer and feedback provider rather than generating full essays for students.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "Experienced IELTS writing teachers provided exemplar marked essays, evaluative comments, and revision principles that informed the design of the chatbot’s feedback flow and functions. During the experiment, instructors ensured participants understood the procedure, delivered the training video, and were available to answer procedural questions but did not mediate or modify chatbot feedback. Human teachers also served as external raters to validate AI scoring reliability.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "On-campus computer labs at a Sino-British university in China; English for Academic Purposes course for first-year undergraduates; GenAI-assisted writing and revision completed in a supervised, face-to-face lab setting using a web-based chatbot interface.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Participants signed an informed consent form before data collection. The study reports that students were informed about the experiment and voluntarily took part. Formal institutional ethics committee approval details beyond funding and institutional support are not reported.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Within the experiment, students accessed the GenAI chatbot via university computer labs and followed a prescribed use sequence defined by the researchers (pre-score, structured revision using specific functions, post-score); additional policies about GenAI use outside the study context or restrictions on other AI tools were not reported.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "NR (no explicit mention of safety filters, content moderation, or guardrails implemented in the chatbot beyond its focus on IELTS writing feedback).",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Both GenAI feedback conditions (visualised and non-visualised) supported significant improvements in writing scores across IELTS criteria between pre- and post-test. However, visualised GenAI feedback led to greater gains in overall revision quality, particularly in coherence and cohesion, where a significant group × time interaction showed that the visualised group outperformed the non-visualised group at post-test with similar baselines. Visualised feedback also significantly reduced foreign language writing anxiety and boredom compared to plain-text feedback and yielded lower perceived cognitive load, while both groups showed increased willingness to write, enjoyment and confidence over time. Perceived teacher-likeness and satisfaction with the chatbot were high in both groups without significant differences, indicating that both formats were viewed as teacher-like and helpful. The findings suggest that the presentation format of AI-generated feedback (visual design) plays a critical role in enhancing EFL revision quality and shaping emotional and cognitive experiences, beyond the content of the feedback itself."
	},
	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Using a self-developed GenAI chatbot aligned with IELTS scoring and providing automated feedback, the study found that both non-visualised and visualised feedback formats significantly improved learners revision quality from pre- to post-test across task response, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource and grammatical accuracy. Effectiveness was assessed via chatbot-generated IELTS band scores (pre-score and post-score) and mixed-ANOVA analyses. Visualised feedback produced a significantly larger improvement in coherence and cohesion and higher average post-test scores than plain-text feedback, indicating that emotionally and visually designed GenAI feedback can be more effective than standard text-only GenAI feedback for EFL revision.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "Chatbot Grade function producing band-aligned scores for IELTS Academic Writing Task 2 based on the four official IELTS writing criteria (task response, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy) trained on official sample essays; pre-score (before revision) and post-score (after revision) for each criterion and an overall average score (AVE) were recorded; human raters also scored a subset of essays using the same IELTS rubric to validate AI scoring.",
		"writing_performance_focus (写作表现关注维度_流利度_准确性_复杂度_体裁等)": "Task response (TR); coherence and cohesion (CC); lexical resource (LR); grammatical range and accuracy (GRA); and an average overall writing score (AVE) emphasizing discourse-level coherence and cohesion, lexical quality and grammatical accuracy in argumentative IELTS-style writing.",
		"affective_aspect_measure (情感因素测量工具_问卷_量表等)": "Pre- and post-surveys using five-point Likert scales: willingness to write (WTW; 5 items adapted from Rafiee and Abbasian-Naghneh, 2020); foreign language writing enjoyment (ENY; 5 items); foreign language writing anxiety (ANX; 8 items); foreign language writing boredom (4 items); foreign language writing confidence (CON; 4 items) adapted from MacIntyre et al., 1998, Wang and Wang, 2024 and Wang et al., 2025.",
		"affective_aspect_focus (情感因素维度_动机_态度_焦虑_自效感等)": "Willingness to write (motivation and readiness to engage in EFL writing); foreign language writing enjoyment (positive affect and pleasure in writing); foreign language writing anxiety (negative emotional arousal and worry during writing); foreign language writing boredom (disengagement and lack of challenge); and foreign language writing confidence (self-confidence in L2 writing ability).",
		"cognitive_aspect_measure (认知因素测量工具)": "Post-test five-item cognitive load (CL) scale on a five-point Likert scale adapted from Li and Wang, 2024 to measure perceived mental effort during the GenAI-assisted writing revision process.",

		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "Perceived teacher-likeness of the chatbot (extent to which feedback felt like that of a human teacher); overall satisfaction with the GenAI feedback; reliability of AI scoring compared with human ratings; and human-computer interaction quality as reflected in CL, TL and SA.",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Pre-test: initial writing (pre-score from chatbot) and pre-survey of willingness to write and writing emotions; Post-test (same session): revised writing (post-score from chatbot) and post-survey of willingness to write and writing emotions in the chatbot-feedback context plus additional post-only measures of cognitive load, teacher-likeness and satisfaction; no delayed follow-up assessment.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Writing performance revision scores on task response, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy and overall average score; willingness to write; foreign language writing enjoyment; foreign language writing anxiety; foreign language writing boredom; foreign language writing confidence; cognitive load (post-only); perceived teacher-likeness (post-only); satisfaction (post-only).",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Feedback mode (between-subjects factor: non-visualised GenAI feedback vs visualised GenAI feedback); time (within-subjects factor: pre-test vs post-test); for some analyses, group × time interaction; for post-only variables, group (feedback mode) as the independent variable.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA (no delayed or longitudinal follow-up beyond the immediate post-test within a single session).",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Mixed-ANOVA showed significant main effects of time for willingness to write, enjoyment, confidence and writing scores, with p<0.001, indicating improvements from pre- to post-test in both groups. Anxiety decreased significantly over time (p<0.001) and showed a significant main effect of group (p≈0.034), with post hoc tests indicating that after revision learners in the visualised feedback group reported significantly lower anxiety than those in the non-visualised group (t≈2.203, p≈0.032). Boredom also decreased significantly over time (p≈0.003) with a significant group effect (p≈0.024), and post hoc results showed lower post-test boredom in the visualised group than in the non-visualised group (t≈2.542, p≈0.014). For writing scores, time effects were significant for all IELTS dimensions (p<0.001). Group effects were significant for task response (p≈0.035), coherence and cohesion (p≈0.009), lexical resource (p≈0.041) and average score (p≈0.020), generally favouring the visualised group. A significant group × time interaction occurred for coherence and cohesion (F≈5.33, p≈0.025), with post hoc comparisons indicating that the visualised group outperformed the non-visualised group at post-test (estimate difference≈0.600, p≈0.009) and showed a larger gain from pre- to post-test. Independent samples t-tests showed significantly lower post-test cognitive load in the visualised group than in the non-visualised group (t(58)≈2.847, p≈0.006); no significant group differences were found for teacher-likeness or satisfaction (p>0.4).",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Partial eta squared values indicated moderate-to-large time effects on positive emotions (for example, enjoyment η²ₚ≈0.58; willingness to write η²ₚ≈0.34; confidence η²ₚ≈0.35) and on writing performance (for example, coherence and cohesion time effect η²ₚ≈0.63; average score time effect η²ₚ≈0.68). Group effects were small-to-moderate for anxiety (η²ₚ≈0.08) and boredom (η²ₚ≈0.09), and moderate for coherence and cohesion (η²ₚ≈0.11). The group × time interaction effect size for coherence and cohesion was η²ₚ≈0.08. For cognitive load, the independent-samples t-test yielded Cohen’s d≈0.88, indicating a medium-to-large reduction in perceived cognitive load for the visualised group compared to the non-visualised group.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "No instances of misuse of the GenAI chatbot (such as plagiarism or replacing writing with AI-generated text) were reported. Potential negative effects discussed relate to plain text GenAI output imposing higher cognitive load and contributing to negative emotions such as anxiety and boredom, particularly when outputs are verbose and cognitively demanding; the visualised feedback design was proposed and shown to mitigate these issues by reducing cognitive load and improving emotional experiences. No adverse outcomes or risks specific to the visualised GenAI feedback were reported in the results.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "No subgroup analyses by gender, initial proficiency bands within B1+–B2−, or other demographic characteristics were reported; equity considerations and differential effects across subgroups were not analysed.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "The study acknowledges several limitations: relatively small sample size (N=60) from a single Sino-British university limits generalisability; only a single round of revision was implemented due to time and logistical constraints, whereas writing development is cumulative and would benefit from longitudinal or multi-stage designs; lack of qualitative data means the study could not capture in-depth learner perceptions or interaction processes with GenAI feedback; visual design elements such as colour-coding were not culturally adapted, leaving open questions about cultural variability in interpreting visual cues; and the results reflect only one specific GenAI chatbot configuration and one genre (IELTS argumentative essays).",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges and risks highlighted include the high cognitive demands of processing long, plain-text GenAI outputs in writing revision tasks, the need to design feedback that reduces extraneous cognitive load and supports positive emotions, the practical constraints of running only a single revision cycle within scheduled lab sessions, and the difficulty of ensuring that visual design elements are optimally tuned for diverse learners without cultural adaptation; additionally, ensuring that students understand and appropriately use multiple chatbot functions (Grade, Outline, Fix Grammar, etc.) requires careful training and interface design.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research directions suggested include conducting longitudinal or multi-stage studies to examine sustained effects of visualised GenAI feedback on writing development; using mixed-methods approaches, including qualitative data (e.g., interviews, screen recordings) to gain richer insight into learners emotional experiences and interaction patterns with GenAI tools; exploring culturally responsive visual design adaptations to account for cultural differences in interpreting visual cues; testing visualised GenAI feedback in other genres and proficiency levels; and further refining GenAI feedback design in line with Cognitive Load Theory and the Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning with Media to accommodate diverse learner profiles.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The findings imply that GenAI chatbots can effectively support EFL learners revision and improve writing quality, and that visualisation of AI feedback (colour-coding, structured layout, tables, mind maps) can enhance discourse-level revision (especially coherence and cohesion), reduce negative emotions such as anxiety and boredom and lower cognitive load. For theory, the study extends the Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning with Media to GenAI-assisted EFL writing, demonstrating how positive emotional design of AI feedback can jointly shape cognitive processing and affect. For practice, it suggests that language teachers and developers should not only focus on the content of AI-generated feedback but also on its visual presentation, integrating GenAI as a teacher-like co-tutor that provides clear, structured, emotionally supportive feedback while reducing teacher workload and fostering learner autonomy in revision."
