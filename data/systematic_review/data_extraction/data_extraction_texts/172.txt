	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "Writing course of ten modules over fifteen weeks with one 3-hour class per week (approximately 1.5 hours of teacher-led instruction plus 1 hour of in-class writing), followed by group-specific follow-up activities each week; the ChatGPT-based and paper-based DDL treatments were implemented over approximately 10 sessions.",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "ChatGPT (GPT-3.5).",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) accessed via the standard web interface at chat.openai.com on students’ mobile devices during class time; used to paraphrase students’ own paragraphs and essays based on student-entered prompts; no API keys, temperature settings, or other technical parameters were reported.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students in Experimental Group 2 interacted directly with ChatGPT on their personal mobile devices during class under teacher guidance, submitting their own compositions to receive paraphrased versions; ChatGPT was not embedded in a separate platform and teachers did not intermediate individual AI outputs beyond initial training and task framing.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "At the start of the course, EG2 students were trained to paste their own paragraphs or essays into ChatGPT and prompt it to paraphrase their original texts rather than generate new content or assign scores; they then compared ChatGPT’s paraphrases with their own writing using guided worksheets aligned with IELTS rubric categories (e.g., coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, grammatical range) and task-specific prompt questions such as asking students to identify words and structures in ChatGPT’s thesis statement that were not in their original thesis statement and evaluate whether those changes were beneficial.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "EG2 received a structured introductory session explaining ChatGPT’s capabilities and limitations, emphasizing that it should not be used to compose or simply correct assignments or grade writing, but to paraphrase their own compositions to support reflection; students were shown how to input their writing, craft paraphrasing prompts, refine queries, and use guided worksheets to critically compare AI and original texts; ethical use, paraphrasing versus plagiarism, and the role of ChatGPT as a supplementary aid alongside textbooks and teacher feedback were discussed.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "Each week all groups attended the same 3-hour writing class covering topics such as thesis statements, topic sentences, evidence and examples, coherence, synthesizing main points, and conclusions; all students wrote an in-class paragraph or short essay (about 250 words) on paper. After writing, the control group spent the remainder of class using the EnglishScore mobile app for general grammar and vocabulary practice unrelated to the specific writing tasks, ensuring equal time-on-task. EG1 received paper-based DDL: they analyzed printed IELTS sample essays provided by the instructor using handouts with questions focusing on discourse-level features of introductions, body paragraphs, and conclusions, and compared these models with their own writing. EG2 used ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) on mobile devices: after entering their compositions and obtaining paraphrased versions from ChatGPT, they completed online worksheets with guided comparison questions targeting coherence/cohesion, lexical choice, and grammar. Pretest essays were administered before these treatments, and a posttest essay was administered two days after the final class session.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Experimental Group 1: paper-based data-driven learning in which students compared their own writing with printed IELTS sample essays using guided handouts to analyze features such as effective introductions, body development, and conclusions. Experimental Group 2: ChatGPT-based data-driven learning in which students submitted their own paragraphs or essays to ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) for paraphrasing, then used structured worksheets to compare AI paraphrases with their originals at the levels of vocabulary, grammar, cohesion, and discourse organization, reflecting on differences and revising their writing accordingly.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Control group followed the usual textbook-centric curriculum for the pre-sessional writing course, writing the same in-class essays but not engaging in paper-based or ChatGPT-based DDL; after writing, they spent the remaining class time using the EnglishScore mobile app for standardized practice in general English grammar and vocabulary, which supported overall language learning but did not provide targeted data-driven feedback on their specific writing tasks.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Drafting, feedback/consultation, and revision stages of short academic essays: students first produced in-class drafts, then either engaged in model-based comparison (EG1), ChatGPT paraphrase comparison (EG2), or generic language practice (control), with opportunities for reflection and revision of their writing.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Short academic and opinion essays resembling IELTS Writing Task 2 essays, including prompts requiring thesis statements, arguments with supporting evidence, paraphrasing of questions, and coherent introductions, bodies, and conclusions.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Timed in-class paragraph or short essay writing tasks of approximately 250 words based on modules such as introductory paragraphs, paraphrasing, argument development, and comparison; pretest and posttest essays written under exam-like conditions.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) served as an AI-powered paraphrasing and language-analyst tool that generated alternative versions of students’ original compositions, providing implicit feedback on grammar, lexical choice, syntactic structures, and discourse organization for students to compare, reflect upon, and selectively incorporate; it was not used to generate essays from scratch or to assign grades.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "Instructors designed and delivered the common writing curriculum, facilitated DDL activities, introduced and modelled appropriate uses of ChatGPT, provided worksheets for guided comparison, monitored students’ AI use, clarified difficult AI-suggested language, and supported students in interpreting and adapting AI feedback; they also implemented the paper-based DDL in EG1 and ensured that the control group’s EnglishScore practice did not overlap with the specific writing outcomes being studied.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Face-to-face foundational academic writing course for international EFL students at a Thai private university, with mobile-assisted use of ChatGPT (and EnglishScore) during class time.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Ethical approval for the study was obtained prior to data collection; all participants were informed about the study and signed written consent forms before participation; anonymity and confidentiality were maintained, and the authors declared no potential conflicts of interest regarding the research, authorship, or publication.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "In EG2 ChatGPT was used during class time on mobile devices under instructor supervision; students were instructed to use it strictly to paraphrase their own compositions and for comparative analysis, not to generate wholly new content, not to rely on it for automated scoring, and to treat it as a supplementary aid alongside other academic resources.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "Pedagogical guardrails included clarifying that ChatGPT outputs must be critically evaluated and adapted, not accepted uncritically; emphasizing responsible and ethical use to avoid plagiarism and overreliance; instructing students to preserve their own ideas and meanings when paraphrasing; and highlighting the possibility of inaccurate or overly advanced AI language, with teacher support provided to help interpret and adjust suggestions; no specific technical safety filters beyond ChatGPT’s default behavior were reported.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "After controlling for baseline differences via ANCOVA, the ChatGPT-based group (EG2) showed significantly higher posttest writing scores than both the control group and the paper-based DDL group, with a very large within-group effect size (Cohen’s d=2.56), whereas the control and EG1 groups exhibited only small improvements; this indicates that using ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) to paraphrase students’ own essays within a guided DDL framework substantially enhanced academic writing proficiency. Questionnaire data showed high satisfaction in both experimental groups, with EG2 reporting particularly positive attitudes toward ChatGPT’s role in improving writing skills, idea generation, ease of use, error identification, motivation, and personalized feedback, although confidence in independently using AI tools was somewhat lower (mean 3.5). Interview data revealed that EG2 students perceived ChatGPT as beneficial for vocabulary building, grammar accuracy, clarity, smoother organization, engagement, and motivation, while also reporting challenges such as overly advanced language, occasional comprehension difficulties, and the continued need for teacher guidance, supporting the view that ChatGPT is an effective but complementary tool for EFL writing instruction."

		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Pretest administered before the start of the treatments; posttest administered to all participants two days after the final class session; no delayed posttest or long-term follow-up was conducted.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Posttest essay writing scores on the 0–100 analytic rubric (with pretest scores included as a covariate in ANCOVA) across the three groups (control, paper-based DDL, ChatGPT-based DDL).",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Between-subject factor of teaching method/condition with three levels (control textbook-centric curriculum plus EnglishScore practice, Experimental Group 1 paper-based data-driven learning with IELTS model essays, Experimental Group 2 ChatGPT-based data-driven learning using paraphrasing and guided comparison); pretest writing score as a covariate.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Pretest ANOVA showed significant differences among groups, with EG2 scoring significantly lower than both the control group and EG1 (p=0.001), while the control and EG1 did not differ significantly (p=0.9). ANCOVA on posttest scores controlling for pretest revealed a significant effect of teaching method on posttest performance, F(2,88)=31.58, p<0.00001, and a significant effect of pretest scores as covariate, F(1,88)=6.50, p=0.01254. Post hoc comparisons indicated no significant difference between control and EG1 posttest scores, but significant differences between EG2 and each of the other groups, with EG2 achieving the highest scores (posttest means approximately 74.03%, 73.68%, and 94.3% for control, EG1, and EG2 respectively).",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Within-group effect sizes (Cohen’s d) from pretest to posttest were small for the control group (d=0.15) and EG1 (d=0.12) but very large for the ChatGPT-based EG2 (d=2.56), indicating that the ChatGPT paraphrasing and DDL approach was associated with substantial improvement in writing scores compared to modest gains in the other groups.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "Students and authors raised concerns that ChatGPT can sometimes produce language that is too advanced or overly formal for learners’ current level, leading to comprehension difficulties and the need to rely on translation tools; there is a risk that students may over-rely on AI suggestions, potentially weakening autonomous critical thinking and writing; AI hallucinations and inaccurate or awkward phrasing remain possible, requiring verification and teacher mediation; and ethical issues such as plagiarism, overdependence on AI-generated text, and reduced ownership of writing were highlighted, prompting calls for explicit guidance and monitoring to ensure responsible use.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "The study notes that not all students have access to suitable devices or stable internet connections, which motivated the inclusion of a paper-based DDL group as a low-tech alternative; EG2 began with lower pretest writing scores than the other groups but showed the largest gains after the ChatGPT intervention, suggesting potential benefits for initially weaker writers, although no formal subgroup analysis by proficiency, gender, or nationality was conducted.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Limitations include the quasi-experimental use of intact classes resulting in substantial baseline differences in writing skills between groups, especially lower pretest scores in EG2; difficulty accurately gauging the extent and quality of each learner’s engagement with ChatGPT; a relatively short 10-session treatment period limiting depth of skill development; reliance on a single institutional context with predominantly Chinese international students at one Thai private university; and the absence of delayed posttesting to assess longer-term retention of writing gains.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges comprised variability in students’ access to mobile devices and internet connectivity, the need to train both teachers and students in effective prompting and critical use of AI tools, the risk that learners might misunderstand or overuse advanced language suggested by ChatGPT, and the ongoing requirement for teacher support to scaffold AI-assisted learning and manage ethical and academic integrity concerns.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Suggested directions include exploring different ways of integrating ChatGPT into various classroom settings and proficiency levels (including lower-level learners), examining other aspects and genres of essay writing, extending program duration for more comprehensive skill development, incorporating measures of actual AI usage and engagement, testing alternative AI tools and configurations, and investigating how to best combine AI support with paper-based DDL to ensure equitable access and maximize learning gains.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study implies that ChatGPT, when used to paraphrase learners’ own writing within a guided data-driven learning framework, can serve as an effective, mobile-accessible scaffold for developing academic essay writing skills, enhancing motivation and engagement, and fostering metalinguistic awareness; it underscores the evolving role of teachers as AI literacy coaches who design structured AI-integrated tasks, support ethical and critical use of AI, and adapt curricula and assessment to reflect process-oriented, AI-aware writing pedagogy."
