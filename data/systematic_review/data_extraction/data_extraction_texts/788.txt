		"theoretical_foundation (理论基础_理论框架)": "Grounded in genre-specific perspectives on narrative writing and syntactic complexity in L2 writing (e.g. Kormos, Knapp and Watkins, Lu, Ortega), plus contemporary discussions on AI-assisted language learning, hallucination risk, prompt literacy, and the need to align writing assessment with genre characteristics.",
		"data_collection_instrument (数据收集工具)": "Narrative pre-test and post-test writing tasks based on scenes from the film I Don’t Know How She Does It; analytic narrative writing scoring rubric adapted from Smarter Balanced Narrative Writing Rubric and genre-based frameworks (Macken-Horarik and Sandiford, Pourdana and Asghari), with five criteria: narrative focus, organization, elaboration, language and vocabulary, conventions; L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA) for fluency and syntactic indices (words, T-units, MLT, clauses per T-unit); Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Syntactic Sophistication and Complexity (TAASSC) for clause and phrase complexity, including clausal complements per clause; ChatGPT editing feedback analysis templates collecting students’ prompts, original sentences, ChatGPT outputs, and students’ analyses; demographic questionnaire including TOEIC scores, major, prior ChatGPT experience, and history of English learning.",
		"data_collection_validity_reliability (工具信度与效度)": "Normality of key variables checked via skewness, kurtosis, and Shapiro–Wilk tests (all within acceptable range, p>.05 except overall performance). Inter-rater reliability for overall performance scores from two assessors (researcher and teaching assistant) was high, Pearson r=.84, with disagreements resolved by consensus discussion. Inter-rater reliability for prompt categorisation yielded Cohen Kappa=.80 (substantial agreement). Automated tools L2SCA and TAASSC are established instruments for L2 syntactic complexity analysis.",
		"data_analysis_method (数据分析方法)": "SPSS used for descriptive statistics, normality checks, and inferential tests. Paired-sample t-tests assessed differences between pre-test and post-test for fluency (words, T-units) and syntactic complexity indices (MLT, C/T, and 31 clause-complexity measures). For overall performance scores (non-normal), Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared pre and post scores. Bonferroni correction adjusted alpha to 0.008 to control Type I error when testing multiple hypotheses. Prompt categories were frequency-counted, and examples of errors and ChatGPT corrections were qualitatively analysed.",
		"unit_of_analysis (分析单位)": "Individual student texts (pre- and post-test narratives) for fluency, syntactic complexity, and overall performance; individual prompts and sentences for ChatGPT usage-pattern analysis.",
		"group_assignment_method (组别分配方式_随机_非随机等)": "Non-random single-group design; all consenting students in the course received the ChatGPT-assisted narrative writing intervention; no separate control group.",
		"power_analysis (功效分析与样本量论证)": "A priori power analysis conducted using G*Power 3.1.9.7 to determine minimum sample size for hypothesis testing; from 60 enrolled students, 44 who provided consent met the required size and were included.",
		"sampling_frame_and_representativeness (抽样框与样本代表性)": "Sampling frame was one English course at a Korean university during March–June 2023; participants from varied majors and proficiency levels, but confined to a single institutional and national context, limiting broader representativeness.",
		"scoring_procedure_and_rater_training (评分流程与评分者培训)": "Two assessors (course instructor and teaching assistant) blind-rated pre- and post-test narrative texts using a modified analytic narrative writing rubric. They independently scored texts, discussed discrepancies, and reached consensus, achieving inter-rater reliability r=.84.

Students’ ChatGPT editing feedback analyses were coded into prompt categories by two raters with Kappa=.80, after training based on Han’s categorisation framework."
	},
	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "One 15-week semester (March–June 2023); class met once a week for 3 hours. Week 1 orientation and pre-test; week 2 instruction on narrative writing and ChatGPT prompts; weeks 3–14 narrative writing instruction plus three in-class narrative writing assignments with ChatGPT-assisted revision; week 15 submission of ChatGPT editing feedback analysis and post-test narrative writing.",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "ChatGPT (GPT-3.5, free version)",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "Free version of ChatGPT-3.5 accessed via the standard web interface during March–June 2023; no API use, no explicit parameter configuration (e.g., temperature) reported.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students interacted directly with ChatGPT via the web interface during class under instructor supervision and used it to revise their own narrative paragraphs; ChatGPT was not embedded in an LMS but used as a stand-alone tool integrated into in-class writing and revision activities.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "In week 2, students were taught various ChatGPT prompts for suggestions and editing, focusing on clarity, grammar, coherence, style, tone, and level of difficulty. During revision, they typically used simple revision prompts (for example, asking ChatGPT to edit or proofread text), but some also crafted more specific prompts requesting narrative style, informality, simplified English, explanations of grammatical points, translation, or evaluative comments. They were instructed, following Sovrano et al., to request feedback only on sentences they themselves wrote to minimise hallucination risks.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Students received explicit instruction on narrative writing and on how to use ChatGPT for editing and feedback (week 2), including how to ask for suggestions and improvements to clarity, grammar, and coherence. They later prepared a ChatGPT editing feedback analysis in which they critically examined ChatGPT suggestions and reflected on underlying grammar and usage, thereby building emerging prompt literacy and awareness of AI limitations; the paper also conceptually argues for prompt literacy education and heterogenous group work to support less proficient learners.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "Week 1: Orientation, explanation of course structure and narrative writing, initial viewing of the film I Don’t Know How She Does It, and pre-test (15 minutes narrative from protagonist Kate’s perspective about making a fake pie for her daughter’s bake sale). Week 2: Instruction on narrative writing features and introduction to ChatGPT prompts for editing and suggestions. Weeks 3–14: Students received narrative writing instruction, watched scenes from the film, discussed characters and cultural themes, and completed three in-class narrative writing assignments relating film themes to personal experiences. Immediately after writing each piece, students used ChatGPT in class to revise their texts, requesting editing, style adjustment, explanation of grammar points, translation, or other support. They selected 15 sentences from their writings, asked ChatGPT for feedback, and later analysed the feedback. Week 15: Students submitted a ChatGPT editing feedback analysis report containing original sentences, prompts, ChatGPT outputs, and their own analysis and revision, and then completed a post-test narrative (15 minutes) retelling a different scene (email mistake to the boss) from Kate’s perspective. Throughout, writing tasks were done in class to address plagiarism and ethical concerns.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "All 44 participating students experienced the ChatGPT-assisted narrative writing intervention: instruction in narrative writing, explicit training in ChatGPT prompts, three in-class narrative writing tasks followed by ChatGPT-based revision, and pre- and post-test narrative writing without ChatGPT assistance for measurement.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "NA",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "ChatGPT was used primarily at the revision and editing stage: after students drafted narrative paragraphs, they sought ChatGPT feedback on grammar, vocabulary, style, tone, and coherence, revised their sentences based on this feedback, and analysed the changes; pre-test and post-test writing tasks themselves were composed without ChatGPT.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Narrative writing, specifically narrative paragraphs retelling events from a film and connecting to personal experience, with emphasis on narrative focus, plot, elaboration, and use of dialogue.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Time-limited in-class narrative paragraphs (pre-test and post-test 15 minutes each) retelling specific scenes from the film from the protagonist’s point of view; additional in-class narrative assignments linking personal experiences to film themes.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "ChatGPT acted as a writing assistant: editing and proofreading for grammar, vocabulary, and coherence; suggesting native-like expressions and alternative word choices; adjusting style, tone, and formality; simplifying language to lower proficiency levels; translating student-produced Korean sentences into English; providing metalinguistic explanations and examples; and occasionally offering evaluative comments on sentence quality.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "The instructor designed and delivered narrative writing instruction, selected film and materials, introduced and demonstrated ChatGPT prompts, supervised in-class use of ChatGPT to prevent plagiarism and overreliance, guided students in analysing ChatGPT feedback, and focused teacher feedback increasingly on content, genre features, and higher-order writing skills while allowing ChatGPT to handle many surface-level issues.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "University-level EFL course in South Korea; one 3-hour class per week over 15 weeks; modality (face-to-face or online) not explicitly reported.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "All 44 participants reviewed the study objectives and procedures, provided informed consent, and were informed that participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw at any time; ethical concerns about plagiarism and AI use were addressed by having students complete and revise their writing in class under supervision.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Free version of ChatGPT-3.5 was used as an instructional support tool during class only; students used ChatGPT in-class for editing and feedback on their own sentences and were required to produce pre-test and post-test narratives without ChatGPT; assignments were done under supervision to mitigate plagiarism and ethical issues related to AI-generated text.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "To reduce hallucination, the course focused on narrative tasks retelling known film scenes, where content accuracy was verifiable, and students were instructed to ask ChatGPT to provide feedback only on their own sentences rather than generate content from scratch. Writing was completed and revised in class to address concerns about plagiarism, difficulty distinguishing student-generated from AI-generated text, and ethical use of generative AI.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Students’ interactions with ChatGPT in the revision stage were dominated by requests for language use (about two-thirds of prompts), especially grammar and vocabulary editing and proofreading, followed by requests for style and tone adjustment, translation, information about language use, and evaluation. ChatGPT was effective at detecting and correcting surface-level errors (tense, articles, word choice, verb variety, wordiness, and some coherence issues) and providing more native-like expressions, though it did not cover all issues. Quantitatively, the ChatGPT-assisted intervention led to significantly higher writing fluency (more than doubling average number of words and T-units) and significantly improved overall performance scores on the narrative rubric, with large effect sizes. Mean length of T-unit decreased significantly while clauses per T-unit did not change significantly, but clausal complements per clause increased significantly, which the author interprets as a genre-appropriate increase in narrative elements such as dialogue and reported speech rather than a regression in proficiency."
	},
	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "The ChatGPT-assisted narrative writing intervention improved learners’ narrative writing performance: students produced substantially longer texts with more T-units, and their rubric-based overall performance scores increased significantly. Syntactic complexity as measured by mean length of T-unit decreased, while clausal complements per clause increased, suggesting a shift toward more genre-appropriate narrative style rather than a straightforward gain in global syntactic complexity. These effects were measured with L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer, TAASSC, and an analytic narrative writing rubric scored by two raters.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "Analytic narrative writing scoring rubric adapted from Smarter Balanced Narrative Writing Rubric and genre-based frameworks (Macken-Horarik and Sandiford, Pourdana and Asghari) with five criteria: narrative focus, organization, elaboration, language and vocabulary, conventions; L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer for fluency (number of words, number of T-units) and syntactic complexity (mean length of T-unit, clauses per T-unit); TAASSC for detailed clause complexity indices including clausal complements per clause.",
		"writing_performance_focus (写作表现关注维度_流利度_准确性_复杂度_体裁等)": "Writing fluency (number of words per text, number of T-units per text); syntactic complexity (mean length of T-unit, clauses per T-unit, clausal complements per clause); genre-specific narrative performance dimensions: narrative focus (setting, characters, point of view), organization (plot and sequence, openings and closures, cohesive devices), elaboration (details, dialogue, description), language and vocabulary (vivid and descriptive word choice), and conventions (grammar, length, mechanics).",

		"behavioral_aspect_measure (行为因素测量工具_日志_平台日志等)": "ChatGPT editing feedback analysis reports documenting 15 student-selected sentences per learner, the prompts used with ChatGPT, ChatGPT outputs, and student analyses; these were coded into prompt categories with inter-rater reliability (Cohen Kappa=.80).",
		"behavioral_aspect_focus (行为因素维度_使用频率_交互模式_坚持度等)": "Patterns of ChatGPT usage during revision, including frequency and types of prompts (language use, revision beyond language, translation, information, evaluation), how students responded to and applied ChatGPT feedback, and the extent to which they requested simplification, style changes, and metalinguistic explanations.",
		"other_outcomes_measure (其他结果测量工具)": "Qualitative categorisation of error types corrected by ChatGPT based on students’ reports and examples; no additional formal psychometric instruments beyond those for writing performance.",
		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "Types of errors ChatGPT commonly corrected, including tense, article use, limited verb variety (overuse of copular verbs), lack of coherence and clarity, verbosity and wordiness, and word choice or collocational usage; discussion of how exposure to these corrections may help students notice language patterns and editing strategies.",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Pre-test narrative writing in week 1 (15-minute narrative retelling of a film scene from Kate’s perspective about making a fake pie); post-test narrative writing in week 15 (15-minute narrative retelling of another film scene about an email mistake to the boss from Kate’s perspective); no delayed follow-up beyond week 15.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Number of words per text, number of T-units per text, mean length of T-unit, clauses per T-unit, clausal complements per clause, and overall narrative writing performance scores on the analytic rubric.",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Time (within-subject factor: pre-test vs post-test) under a constant instructional condition of a ChatGPT-assisted narrative writing course; there was no between-group comparison factor.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Paired-sample t-tests showed significant increases in fluency: number of words t=-9.441, p<.001, number of T-units t=-10.461, p<.001. MLT decreased significantly (t=3.617, p=.001), while C/T did not change significantly (t=1.437, p=.158). Among 31 clause-complexity measures, only clausal complements per clause increased significantly (t=-3.722, p=.001). Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated a significant improvement in overall narrative performance scores from pre to post (Z=-5.726, p<.001). All significant findings were evaluated using a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha of .008.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Very large effects for fluency: number of words Cohen d=1.71, number of T-units d=2.10; medium-to-large effect for the decrease in MLT d=0.67; small effect and non-significant for change in C/T d=0.30; large effect for improved overall performance scores d=1.48; large effect for increase in clausal complements per clause d=0.85.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The study highlights risks of students over-relying on ChatGPT instead of thinking and writing independently, and concerns about hallucination (fabricated but plausible information), especially when prompts request information beyond students’ own text. It notes the difficulty of distinguishing AI-generated from student-generated writing and the challenge for plagiarism detection. It also observes that ChatGPT mainly handles surface-level issues and does not address deeper genre-specific features or all types of errors, underscoring limitations of relying solely on ChatGPT for feedback and the need for teacher oversight.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "The article notes that more advanced English learners tended to critically evaluate ChatGPT outputs, ask for clarification and elaboration, and integrate new information with existing knowledge, whereas beginners were more likely to accept ChatGPT outputs uncritically, even when sentences were complex and contained unfamiliar vocabulary. This suggests potential disparities in benefits of ChatGPT use according to proficiency level. The author recommends heterogeneous grouping and collaborative prompt design to support less proficient students. No formal subgroup statistical analyses (e.g., by TOEIC band, gender, or major) were reported.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Exploratory design with no control group or alternative feedback condition; relatively small sample of 44 students from a single English course and one Korean university, limiting generalisability; prompt data drawn from a limited number of sentences per student; ChatGPT editing feedback analysis relied on student self-reports which may affect objectivity; no detailed statistical analysis by proficiency level or other subgroups; machine-based syntactic complexity measures (e.g., MLT) do not fully capture genre-specific sophistication in narrative writing, highlighting limits of automated scoring.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Challenges include designing writing tasks and assessments that meaningfully incorporate ChatGPT while discouraging wholesale AI-generated writing; monitoring in-class AI use to mitigate plagiarism and ensure ethical use; training students and teachers in prompt literacy and digital competence; dealing with hallucination and inaccurate AI feedback; and interpreting automated measures of syntactic complexity that may misrepresent genre-appropriate shifts, such as shorter, more rhythmic sentences in narrative writing.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future studies should include a non-AI feedback or alternative-feedback control group to compare trajectories with and without ChatGPT, expand to more courses and educational contexts, collect and analyse a larger and more comprehensive set of prompts, and conduct detailed analyses by proficiency level to better understand how AI-assisted writing interacts with learner characteristics. There is also a need to develop AI assessment tools that incorporate genre-specific features, and to further investigate how prompt literacy and collaborative prompt design can optimise AI-supported narrative writing.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study suggests that ChatGPT can serve as a substitute language tutor for surface-level aspects of writing by providing abundant real-time feedback on grammar, vocabulary, and style, enabling teachers to reorient their feedback toward content, genre-specific features, logical development, and higher-order writing skills. It underscores the importance of prompt literacy education so learners can craft specific, purposeful prompts, evaluate AI outputs critically, and integrate AI as a partner in self-directed learning. It also points to the need for digitally competent language teachers and for AI-based writing assessment tools that recognise genre differences, thereby supporting more accurate and pedagogically meaningful evaluation of L2 writing."
