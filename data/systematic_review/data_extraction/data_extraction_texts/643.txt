		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students in the experimental group interacted directly with ChatGPT through its mobile application during class sessions under teacher supervision, using a standardized prompt to request identification and explanation of grammatical errors in their own writing; ChatGPT was used as a standalone tool rather than being embedded in a separate LMS.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "A fixed, researcher-designed prompt was used each time students submitted their text to ChatGPT, beginning with the learner stating that they had written a story in English based on a picture and requesting help to identify grammatical errors, explain each type of error, and provide clarifying examples; no additional explicit prompt engineering strategies such as few-shot examples or step-by-step reasoning were described.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "At the start of the intervention, students in the experimental group were introduced to ChatGPT’s functions and instructed on how to use the mobile app to enhance their English writing, including how to type their stories, apply the standardized prompt, read the feedback, and revise their handwritten texts accordingly; formal training in issues such as plagiarism, critical evaluation of AI output, or citation practices was not reported.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "All participants completed a pretest picture-based narrative writing task (30 minutes, using a word-processing application) to establish baseline writing performance. Over eight weeks, the experimental group wrote 200-word stories in English based on pictures on A4 paper, then manually typed these stories into the ChatGPT mobile app along with a detailed prompt asking ChatGPT to identify and explain grammatical errors and provide example corrections; they reviewed ChatGPT’s feedback and then revised their original handwritten stories. The control group wrote comparable 200-word picture-based stories on A4 paper; researchers identified grammatical errors in their texts, provided explicit teacher feedback on grammar rules, and asked students to revise their original written texts using this teacher feedback. At the end of the intervention, both groups completed a posttest picture-based narrative writing task (30 minutes, using a word-processing application) under the same conditions as the pretest but with different pictures to avoid memory effects. After the intervention, the experimental group also completed a 12-item Likert-scale questionnaire about their experiences using ChatGPT on mobile for English grammar learning.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Experimental group (N=66) received ChatGPT-based feedback: each session they wrote a 200-word English story based on a picture on paper, retyped it into the ChatGPT mobile app using a standardized prompt requesting identification and explanation of grammatical errors (third-person singular present, past tense, progressive, past participle, plural, possessive, comparative, and superlative forms), reviewed ChatGPT’s error explanations and examples, and then revised their handwritten story accordingly.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Control group (N=66) followed a parallel routine without AI tools: they wrote a 200-word English story based on a picture on paper, received teacher feedback in which researchers examined their sheets, identified grammatical errors, and explained the relevant grammar rules, and then revised their original texts based on the teacher’s feedback, following the same eight-week schedule and session length as the experimental group.",

		"other_outcomes_measure (其他结果测量工具)": "NA",
		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "NA",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Pretest picture-based narrative writing task before the 8-week intervention and posttest picture-based narrative writing task after the intervention, using different pictures to prevent recall; no delayed follow-up assessment reported.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Number of grammatical errors per learner per test in eight categories (third-person singular present, past tense, progressive, past participle, plural, possessive, comparative, superlative) as identified by Grammarly AES; and, for the experimental group, Likert-scale ratings of attitudes, motivation, confidence, satisfaction, and willingness to recommend ChatGPT mobile for English grammar learning.",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Feedback condition (experimental group using ChatGPT mobile feedback vs control group using traditional teacher feedback) and test time (pretest vs posttest); grammatical error category served as a repeated-measures factor in the ANOVA analyses.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of grammatical error type, F(7,59)=51.731, p<.001, partial η²=.860, indicating that some error types were more frequent than others; a significant main effect of group (experimental vs control), F(1,65)=13.745, p<.001, showing overall differences in error counts between ChatGPT and teacher feedback; and a significant main effect of test (pretest vs posttest), F(1,65)=123.676, p<.001, indicating substantial reductions in errors over time. The interaction between error type and group was significant, F(7,59)=47.602, p<.001, showing that the relative improvement across error types differed between ChatGPT and control conditions, and the interaction between error type and test was significant, F(7,59)=8.869, p<.001, indicating that some error types improved more from pretest to posttest than others. The group-by-test interaction and the three-way interaction among error type, group, and test were not statistically significant (p>.425 and p>.129 respectively), suggesting that overall pre–post improvement trends were similar in magnitude across groups while differing in pattern across error categories.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "For the main effect of grammatical error type, a large effect size was reported with partial η²=.860; other partial eta-squared values for group and test main effects and interactions were not reported.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The study’s literature review acknowledges potential negative aspects of ChatGPT and similar AI tools such as overreliance on technology, privacy concerns, lack of emotional intelligence, ethical issues, and plagiarism risks, but within the reported experiment no explicit misuse incidents or major negative behavioral effects related to ChatGPT use were documented; limitations noted focus more on short intervention duration and variability in feedback quality than on learner misconduct.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "No subgroup or equity analyses by gender, proficiency level, or other demographic variables were reported; the study did not examine differential effects of ChatGPT across learner subgroups.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Limitations include the relatively short 8-week intervention period, the single-site sample drawn from one senior secondary public school in India, use of convenience and purposive sampling which may limit generalizability, reliance on a limited set of grammatical error categories and automated error detection for outcome measurement, potential variability in ChatGPT feedback quality and its fit to learners’ proficiency levels, and a focus on immediate error reduction without assessing long-term retention or broader aspects of writing quality.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges discussed include the degree to which ChatGPT’s feedback is genuinely tailored to learners’ proficiency levels, the need to supplement AI feedback with human instruction for certain complex grammatical areas such as comparative and superlative forms, the risk that AI feedback might not fully address all learners’ needs, and the broader challenges of aligning AI feedback with educational integrity, avoiding overreliance, and integrating such tools sustainably into existing classroom practices.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research is recommended to extend the intervention duration and examine long-term effects of ChatGPT feedback on writing proficiency, explore more advanced AI models that can better tailor feedback to individual learner profiles and proficiency levels, investigate AI feedback in diverse educational settings and with different age groups, compare ChatGPT with additional AI and non-AI feedback tools, and study how AI-driven feedback can be effectively combined with teacher feedback to support complex aspects of writing and grammar over time.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The findings suggest that integrating ChatGPT mobile feedback into ESL writing instruction can significantly enhance grammatical accuracy and positively influence learners’ motivation and confidence, indicating that AI tools can serve as effective supplements to traditional teacher feedback by offering immediate, personalized, and detailed corrections; pedagogically, the study supports designing curricula that incorporate AI-driven feedback for targeted grammar support while maintaining teacher oversight and emphasizes the need to develop policies and practices that harness AI benefits, sustain learner engagement, and uphold academic integrity."
