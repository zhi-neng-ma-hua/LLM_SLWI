	},
	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "Three main writing sessions of 50 minutes each spaced approximately one month apart within a semester; each session involved planning, drafting, and revising a guided argumentative paragraph using one proofreading condition; preparation and instruction on tools and topics occurred before each session.",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "ChatGPT (OpenAI large language model; specific version not reported) used for translation and proofreading in the CAP condition, alongside a Non LLM tool Google Translate neural machine translation system for the MAP condition.",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "Students accessed ChatGPT on their mobile phones, likely via web interface or app, using fixed prompts such as translate this paragraph to Korean and proofread this paragraph to obtain L1 translations and proofreading suggestions; the underlying model version, default parameters, and technical settings were not reported.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students interacted directly with ChatGPT as an external online tool during the revision stage of their writing tasks, entering their own drafts and reading the AI output within ChatGPT; the tool was not embedded in an LMS but was integrated pedagogically as part of the in class writing procedure with teacher guidance.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "The ChatGPT assisted proofreading condition used a two stage scripted prompting process; first learners sent their English draft to ChatGPT with a translation request prompt translate this paragraph to Korean and checked the Korean output for meaning accuracy before revising their English draft, then they sent the revised English draft to ChatGPT with the proofreading prompt proofread this paragraph and decided whether to accept, reject, or modify the suggested corrections; the authors note that the best prompts for eliciting helpful ChatGPT feedback were determined through iterative prompting and analysis cycles, but no advanced prompt engineering strategies such as few shot or chain of thought prompting were described.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Prior to the main writing sessions, learners were introduced to the writing topics and to Google Translate and ChatGPT, including examples of inaccurate AI output such as unnatural translations of Korean idioms, and were explicitly advised that feedback from MT and ChatGPT might be inaccurate; they were encouraged to critically review AI outputs, check for idiomatic and grammatical appropriateness, and make independent decisions on accepting or modifying suggestions; no extended training on academic integrity, creativity, or broad AI literacy was reported beyond these task focused orientations.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "For each writing task, learners completed a 50 minute guided writing session including idea generation, outlining, drafting, and revision; they wrote short argumentative paragraphs based on textbook derived prompts with sentence frames about topics such as talent versus hard work, controlling negative emotions, and volunteer work as a graduation requirement. In the self proofreading condition SP learners revised their drafts without external resources, reviewing and correcting their own writing before submitting revised and final versions via Google Forms. In the machine translation assisted condition MAP, learners used Google Translate in a two step inverse translation procedure; they entered their English draft to receive a Korean translation, checked and revised their English text based on mismatches, then input the revised English version again, used the swap languages function to have the Korean output translated back into English, and compared the inverse translation with their revised draft to identify remaining problems, all of which were recorded in Google Forms. In the ChatGPT assisted condition CAP, learners used ChatGPT in two stages; first they translated their English drafts into Korean with a translation prompt and revised for meaning accuracy, then they asked ChatGPT to proofread the revised English text with a proofreading prompt and considered the AI suggested corrections when preparing their final version; across the semester, the three methods were administered in different orders to groups A, B, and C following the counterbalanced design.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "AI assisted proofreading interventions consisted of the MAP and CAP conditions; in MAP, learners used Google Translate neural machine translation for one way and inverse translation to identify mismatches between their English drafts and Korean translations, refining their English sentences based on the output; in CAP, learners used ChatGPT to first translate their drafts into Korean and then to proofread the revised English texts, receiving context sensitive suggestions on grammar, wording, and sentence structure and critically deciding what to incorporate into their final writing; these AI based supports operated only at the revision stage, with initial drafting done by learners themselves in English.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "The self proofreading SP condition served as the baseline control, in which learners independently reviewed and revised their drafts without using any external tools, relying solely on their own proofreading skills and then submitting both revised and final versions via Google Forms; no teacher or automated feedback was provided during this control condition.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Revision and proofreading stage of short argumentative writing tasks after initial drafting in L2; AI tools were used only after learners had produced an initial English draft.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Short guided argumentative and opinion paragraphs based on high school textbook themes such as sports talent versus hard work, dealing with negative emotions, and volunteering as a graduation requirement.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Guided writing tasks with sentence frames and starters aligned to textbook content, requiring learners to express and support an opinion in a short argumentative paragraph.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "In the CAP condition, ChatGPT acted as a proofreading and translation assistant that translated learner drafts into L1 Korean to support meaning checking and then provided automated written corrective feedback on revised English drafts by suggesting grammar, word form, sentence structure, and phrasing changes; ChatGPT did not assign scores but functioned as an automated writing evaluation tool for surface and some structural aspects of the text.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "One teacher led the study, introduced the writing topics and the three proofreading tools, demonstrated strengths and limitations of MT and ChatGPT, provided instructions and procedural guidance, ensured that learners understood that AI feedback might be inaccurate and required critical evaluation, and managed the classroom writing sessions; teacher feedback on the specific drafts during revision was not described, as the focus was on learner interaction with the three proofreading methods.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Face to face English as a foreign language classes in a public high school in northwestern Seoul, with writing tasks completed in the classroom during scheduled lessons while students used their mobile phones to access Google Translate and ChatGPT online.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "The article does not describe formal ethics approval procedures or informed consent processes; ethical considerations were not explicitly reported.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Students were allowed to use Google Translate and ChatGPT only as instructed during the designated writing sessions; they were explicitly warned that AI feedback could be inaccurate, were encouraged to make independent acceptance or rejection decisions, and were given example mistranslations to foster a cautious approach; no additional policies regarding use of ChatGPT or MT outside the study were reported.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "NR",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Both machine translation assisted proofreading and ChatGPT assisted proofreading led to significantly higher holistic writing scores than self proofreading, with CAP yielding the highest scores (SP mean 2.37, MAP mean 3.29, CAP mean 3.85 on a 0 to 5 scale; F(2,156)=119.586, p<.001). CAP produced longer texts and greater lexical diversity as measured by MTLD compared to SP and MAP, and showed higher syntactic complexity through greater left embeddedness, although verb cohesion was significantly lower under CAP than under SP or MAP, indicating possible trade offs in cohesion. Cohesion measures showed CAP texts had higher noun overlap than MAP and similar content word overlap to SP. Error analyses revealed that both MAP and CAP markedly reduced grammatical errors in articles, verb forms, and subject verb agreement relative to SP and substantially decreased sentence structure errors, mechanical errors, and mistranslations, with CAP generally outperforming MAP, while preposition errors were not significantly reduced by either tool. Lexical word choice errors did not differ significantly across conditions, and pronoun and some tense errors remained difficult for AI tools to handle. Overall, the study concludes that integrating MT and especially ChatGPT as proofreading tools can substantially enhance L2 writing accuracy, complexity, and holistic quality compared to self revision alone, but also highlights persistent weaknesses such as reduced verb cohesion, unresolved preposition and word choice issues, and the need for human oversight and critical engagement."

		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "Linguistic complexity outcomes included verb cohesion percentiles, noun overlap and content word overlap for referential cohesion, incidence of connectives, type token ratios, MTLD, left embeddedness, and sentence syntax similarity; error outcomes covered structural errors in articles, noun endings, verb tense, verb form, subject verb agreement, prepositions and pronouns, lexical errors in word choice and word form, sentence structure errors such as run ons and fragments, mechanical errors in spelling, punctuation and capitalization, and mistranslations affecting meaning transfer between L1 and L2.",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Each learner completed three separate guided writing tasks during the semester, each revised under a different proofreading condition; holistic scores, linguistic complexity indices, and error counts were obtained from the final texts for each condition; there was no separate pre test versus post test or delayed follow up assessment beyond these three product samples.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Holistic writing scores from the adapted TOEFL iBT rubric; word count and sentence count; CohMetrix indices of cohesion (verb cohesion, noun overlap, content word overlap, connective incidence), lexical diversity (type token ratio, MTLD), and syntactic complexity (left embeddedness, sentence syntax similarity); normalized frequencies per sentence of grammatical, lexical, sentence structure, mechanical, and mistranslation errors.",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Primary independent variable was proofreading condition with three levels self proofreading, machine translation assisted proofreading, and ChatGPT assisted proofreading, administered in a counterbalanced order across three writing tasks; writing topic varied across tasks but remained within the Korean National Curriculum themes and was not formally modeled as a factor in analyses.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "No follow up or delayed post test; the study focused on immediate product outcomes from three writing tasks during one semester.",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Repeated measures ANOVA showed a highly significant main effect of proofreading condition on holistic writing scores with F(2,156)=119.586, p<.001, with MAP and CAP both scoring significantly higher than SP and CAP higher than MAP. For descriptive indices, word count differed significantly across conditions with F(2,156)=14.364, p<.0001, with CAP texts longer than SP and MAP. Verb cohesion showed a significant main effect of condition with F(2,156)=14.302, p<.0001, with SP and MAP texts having higher verb cohesion than CAP. Noun overlap differed significantly with F(2,156)=6.057, p<.01, and CAP texts had higher noun overlap than MAP; MTLD also showed a significant effect F(2,156)=7.207, p<.01, with CAP greater than SP. Left embeddedness yielded a borderline significant effect with F(2,156)=5.683, p≈.004, and post hoc tests indicated higher values for CAP than SP. Error analyses indicated significant main effects of condition for multiple error types including articles F=15.50, verb forms F=11.30, subject verb agreement F=10.51, word form F=8.88, sentence structure F=31.74, mechanics F=21.64, and mistranslations F=31.07, all with p values below the Bonferroni corrected thresholds, with MAP and CAP significantly reducing errors compared with SP and CAP typically outperforming MAP, while preposition, pronoun, and some lexical word choice errors did not differ significantly across conditions.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "The article reports F values and p values but does not provide standardized effect sizes such as partial eta squared or Cohen d; however, the very large F value for holistic scores F(2,156)=119.586 with p<.001 and large F values for several error categories and linguistic indices suggest substantial effects of proofreading condition, especially for improvements in holistic quality, reductions in structural and mechanical errors, increases in word count and lexical diversity under ChatGPT assisted proofreading, and reduced verb cohesion compared to other conditions.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The authors note that ChatGPT proofread texts showed reduced verb cohesion compared with self and MT assisted proofreading, indicating potential weaknesses in maintaining consistent and coherent verb patterns; ChatGPT and MT did not effectively address preposition errors and sometimes failed to correct nuanced word choice such as brain talent or produced awkward phrases, highlighting the risk of learners accepting inappropriate suggestions; pronoun use remained problematic, partly due to L1 pro drop influences and ChatGPT tendency to use singular they; the discussion emphasizes that ChatGPT may prioritize sentence level corrections over global cohesion, can misinterpret writer intent, may introduce new or stylistically odd sentences, and requires human oversight and validation; the authors also caution about possible learning loss, overreliance, reduced creativity and critical thinking, and cultural biases in AI outputs, stressing that ChatGPT cannot replace nuanced human feedback.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "No subgroup or equity analyses by gender, proficiency level, or other demographic factors were reported; equity related issues were not quantitatively examined.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "The study used a product oriented methodology and did not investigate how learners perceived, analyzed, or adopted feedback from MT and ChatGPT, nor how they independently generated strategies or prompts; it examined only immediate revisions within each writing task and did not assess delayed or sustained effects or transfer of AI supported revisions to future independent writing; the prompts for MT and ChatGPT were researcher designed rather than learner generated; and the error taxonomy focused mainly on surface level grammar and mechanics without systematically analyzing higher order writing features such as argumentation, coherence, and organization.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Challenges highlighted include learners difficulties in deciding whether to accept or reject AI suggestions, especially when ChatGPT produces plausible yet contextually inappropriate word choices or sentence structures, the limited effectiveness of both MT and ChatGPT in correcting prepositions, pronouns, and certain word choice errors that require nuanced human judgment, the need for training in digital competencies and prompt use to maximize benefits, concerns about learning loss and reduced critical thinking if students over rely on AI tools, and the presence of cultural biases in ChatGPT outputs due to training data skewed toward English language and Western norms.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "The authors recommend future research that explores learners cognitive and decision making processes when interacting with MT and ChatGPT using methods such as think aloud protocols or screen tracking, conducts longitudinal studies to examine whether and how AI supported proofreading affects subsequent independent writing, second language acquisition, or metacognitive awareness, and extends analysis beyond surface level errors to higher level writing skills such as argumentation, coherence, and organization; they also call for work that examines how critical instruction in linguistic complexity and error correction can support effective integration of MT and ChatGPT and how to address cultural biases and ethical issues in AI assisted writing.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study suggests that combining machine translation assisted proofreading and ChatGPT assisted proofreading with traditional self revision can enhance L2 learners writing development, with MT inverse translation sensitizing learners to cross linguistic differences and message accuracy and CAP improving lexical diversity, syntactic complexity, and accuracy; teachers can integrate these AI tools to handle many lower level concerns, freeing them to focus on higher order aspects such as content and organization, but must provide guidance to ensure learners critically evaluate AI output, avoid overreliance, and remain aware of cultural and ethical issues; more broadly, the findings imply that AWE tools like ChatGPT are valuable supplementary resources rather than replacements for human feedback in L2 writing pedagogy."
