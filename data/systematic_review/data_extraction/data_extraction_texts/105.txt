		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Time (pre-test vs post-test), gender (male vs female), academic major (E-commerce, Information Technology, Legal Assistant).",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA (no follow-up beyond immediate post-test)",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Descriptive statistics showed higher post-test than pre-test means for all writing dimensions and total scores. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for the experimental group indicated significant pre–post gains across all variables (content, format and structure, grammar and punctuation, vocabulary and cohesion, total; all p<.001) with large z-values and rank-biserial correlations (e.g., content W=3704.5, z=7.578, r≈0.935; total W=5972.0, z=8.707, r≈0.956). Repeated-measures analyses reported a highly significant main effect of time (Pre–Post Test F≈1244.235, p<.001, η²≈0.789), a significant time-by-gender interaction (F≈47.924, p<.001, η²≈0.030), and a significant time-by-major interaction (F≈24.663, p<.001, η²≈0.039). Between-subjects analyses showed significant effects of gender on overall improvement (F≈80.446, p<.001, η²≈0.044) and of academic major (F≈40.462, p<.001, η²≈0.056). Levene’s tests indicated variance heterogeneity for Vocabulary and Cohesion and some pre-test totals, leading to use of Welch’s ANOVA for those variables.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Wilcoxon signed-rank tests yielded large rank-biserial correlations for improvements in content (r≈0.935, 95% CI≈0.897–0.960), format and structure (r≈0.877), grammar and punctuation (r≈0.961), vocabulary and cohesion (r≈1.000), and total writing score (r≈0.956). ANOVA-based effect sizes were large for the main time effect (η²≈0.789) and small but non-trivial for interactions and between-subjects factors (time by gender η²≈0.030; time by major η²≈0.039; gender η²≈0.044; major η²≈0.056).",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The study discusses in the literature review several potential negative aspects of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, including concerns about superficial learning, academic dishonesty and students bypassing the hard work of developing writing skills, possible detriments to critical thinking and creativity, legitimacy of AI-generated content, and technological disparities that may exacerbate educational inequality. However, the empirical study did not directly measure misuse or negative outcomes, and no specific incidents of ChatGPT-related misconduct were reported.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "Gender analyses showed that both male and female students significantly improved their ESP writing skills after using ChatGPT, but female students had higher pre-test and post-test means and larger gains across all writing dimensions, with gender explaining about 4.4% of variance in improvement (η²≈0.044). Major-based analyses indicated that students from all three majors (E-commerce, Information Technology, Legal Assistant) improved, with Information Technology majors showing the greatest gains in content, structure, grammar, vocabulary and cohesion, and total scores; academic major explained about 5.6% of the variance in improvement (η²≈0.056). These results suggest modest but statistically significant subgroup differences overlaid on a strong overall positive effect of ChatGPT.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Limitations noted include the use of a one-group pretest–posttest pre-experimental design without a control group, which restricts causal inference and does not rule out maturation or other confounding variables; a relatively small and discipline-specific sample confined to ESP students at one Saudi university; limited generalizability to other disciplines, proficiency levels, and cultural contexts; violations of homogeneity of variance for some variables (e.g., vocabulary and cohesion, some pre-test totals); and the absence of random assignment and broader measures of learning processes beyond writing scores.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Challenges include the methodological constraint of lacking a comparison group, potential confounding factors such as prior language proficiency and motivation, variance heterogeneity in some subskills that required using Welch’s ANOVA, and general concerns from the literature that ChatGPT may enable academic shortcut-taking, superficial learning, or reduced critical thinking if not carefully scaffolded; practical implementation also depends on adequate digital infrastructure and student access to ChatGPT.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research should employ randomized controlled or comparison-group designs, include larger and more diverse samples across different academic disciplines, proficiency levels, and cultural settings, and investigate long-term effects of ChatGPT-supported self-directed learning. Further studies should probe the mechanisms behind gender and major differences, examine additional learner variables (e.g., motivation, learning strategies, prior AI exposure), and address ethical issues such as academic integrity, data privacy, and potential biases in AI outputs.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The findings support the use of ChatGPT as a self-directed learning tool that can substantially enhance ESP writing skills across content, structure, grammar, and vocabulary, aligning with self-directed learning theory by enabling students to set goals, seek feedback, and monitor progress. Pedagogically, results suggest that ESP curricula should incorporate structured ChatGPT use, teacher and learner training in AI literacy and prompt creation, and assessment practices that value both writing quality and human–AI collaboration. The small but significant gender and major effects highlight the need for differentiated support and disciplinary considerations when integrating AI tools to ensure equitable benefits for diverse learner groups."
