		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The study highlighted risks of over-reliance on AI and potential erosion of originality; some students reported that relying too much on ChatGPT made the essay feel less like their own and required them to consciously reduce dependence; ethical guidelines and penalties (such as a zero score for fully AI-generated essays) were implemented to mitigate misuse, and authors emphasized the need to critically evaluate AI outputs and preserve students independent thinking.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "The article discussed gender differences and epistemic beliefs in argumentative writing in the literature review but did not report any subgroup analyses or fairness-related outcomes for its own sample; no sex- or background-based differential effects of the AI and Uncertain Motivation intervention were analyzed.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Single-institution sample of Saudi EFL learners in one Essay Writing course limits generalizability; absence of a control group makes it impossible to disentangle the separate effects of AI, Uncertain Motivation, and Toulmin instruction; relatively short intervention period (approximately eight weeks) with no delayed follow-up; potential cognitive and motivational fatigue across repeated tasks; and lack of detailed reporting on long-term sustainability of gains.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Students initially faced a learning curve in understanding both the Toulmin Model and how to use ChatGPT effectively and ethically; some experienced motivational dips when rewards were perceived as unappealing; there was a risk of cognitive overload from mastering new frameworks and tools simultaneously, and ethical concerns about over-reliance on AI and maintaining academic integrity had to be managed through rules and monitoring.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research should include control or comparison groups to separate the effects of AI, Uncertain Motivation, and Toulmin-based instruction; examine long-term retention of argumentative writing gains after AI support is reduced or removed; explore different reward structures and culturally responsive incentives; analyze subgroup effects (e.g., gender, epistemic beliefs, proficiency levels); and test multimodal or more adaptive AI tools across disciplines and educational contexts.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "Findings suggest that combining Toulmin-based instruction with thoughtfully guided use of ChatGPT and well-designed uncertain rewards can enhance EFL learners argumentative writing, supporting both structural quality and motivation; educators are encouraged to integrate AI as a scaffold rather than a substitute, to explicitly teach ethical and critical AI literacy, and to design gamified motivational systems that align with students interests while curriculum designers and institutions consider AI- and motivation-informed frameworks for writing instruction."
