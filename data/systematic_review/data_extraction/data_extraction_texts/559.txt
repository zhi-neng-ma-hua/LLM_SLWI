For example, strengths in inclusion of key information increased from 70 to 78 students, and weaknesses decreased from 23 to 8; grammar strengths increased from 64 to 71 students while weaknesses decreased from 34 to 13. Students’ self-reported weaknesses in grammar and vocabulary aligned with ChatGPT’s identification of weakness areas, suggesting that ChatGPT feedback can effectively identify and help address key problems. Focus group data indicated that most students (78) viewed ChatGPT as helpful for improving writing, appreciated the detailed feedback, and felt that ChatGPT helped them understand where they were making mistakes, particularly in grammar, vocabulary, conciseness, and use of linking words and reporting verbs. Some students reported challenges in revising more complex features such as passive voice and linking word use, and a few described ChatGPT feedback as poor or insufficiently detailed. Overall, the authors conclude that students can improve their writing skills through ChatGPT feedback and that ChatGPT has significant potential as an innovative AI-driven educational tool for fostering writing proficiency among Gen Z EFL students, while emphasizing that it should be integrated with human instruction and ethical oversight."
