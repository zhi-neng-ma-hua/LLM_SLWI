For each task, students drafted their essays and consulted ChatGPT for immediate feedback on grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. The teacher supervised classroom use to avoid overuse and to encourage meaningful engagement with AI feedback.

		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "After three weeks of ChatGPT-assisted writing practice, descriptive statistics showed increases in mean scores for all five analytic dimensions and total scores: content from 24.60 to 27.00, organization from 16.60 to 18.00, vocabulary from 15.40 to 18.00, language use from 19.50 to 22.00, mechanics from 4.20 to 4.50, and total from 80.30 to 89.50. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test results revealed statistically significant gains in content (Z=2.692, p=0.007), language use (Z=2.214, p=0.027), and total scores (Z=2.449, p=0.014), with vocabulary showing near-significant improvement (Z=1.951, p≈0.051), while organization (Z=1.548, p=0.122) and mechanics (Z=1.342, p=0.180) did not reach statistical significance. Effect sizes indicated large effects for content (r=0.85) and language use (r=0.70), a moderate effect for vocabulary (r=0.62), and smaller effects for organization (r=0.49) and mechanics (r=0.42). Two-Step Cluster Analysis with a silhouette measure of 0.6 (good quality) identified two clusters: one comprising students with lower initial scores and modest improvements (Cluster 1) and another with higher initial scores and larger gains in most writing areas (Cluster 2), suggesting differential responsiveness to the ChatGPT intervention. Overall, the study concludes that AI-assisted learning using ChatGPT is effective in improving high school EFL learners’ writing content, vocabulary, language use, and overall proficiency, with weaker effects on organization and mechanics."

	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Effectiveness of ChatGPT-assisted learning was evaluated through pre-test and post-test analytic writing scores using Jacobs et al.’s rubric and nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests plus effect sizes, complemented by Two-Step Cluster Analysis; results showed statistically significant and educationally meaningful improvements in content, language use, vocabulary (borderline), and total score, indicating that AI-assisted training was practical in enhancing multiple dimensions of EFL writing proficiency over a short three-week period.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "Jacobs et al.’s (1981) ESL Composition Profile analytic scoring rubric assessing content (30 points), organization (20 points), vocabulary (20 points), language use (25 points), and mechanics (5 points).",
		"writing_performance_focus (写作表现关注维度_流利度_准确性_复杂度_体裁等)": "Five core dimensions of writing proficiency: content (development and relevance of ideas), organization (logical flow and structure), vocabulary (range and appropriateness of word choice), language use (grammar, syntax, and complexity), and mechanics (spelling, punctuation, capitalization, paragraphing), plus total writing score.",

		"other_outcomes_measure (其他结果测量工具)": "Two-Step Cluster Analysis of pre-test and post-test writing component and total scores using SPSS v29.",
		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "Identification of learner response patterns to the ChatGPT intervention, with Cluster 1 representing students with lower initial scores and minor improvements and Cluster 2 representing students with higher initial performance and larger gains, illustrating heterogeneous responsiveness to AI-assisted learning.",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Pre-test immediately before the three-week AI-assisted intervention; post-test immediately after completion of the three-week intervention; no delayed follow-up.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Analytic scores for content, organization, vocabulary, language use, mechanics, and total writing score on Jacobs et al.’s rubric at pre-test and post-test.",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Time (pre-test vs post-test); derived cluster membership (Cluster 1 vs Cluster 2) in the Two-Step Cluster Analysis.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA (no follow-up assessment was conducted beyond the immediate post-test).",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test showed significant improvements in Content (Z=2.692, p=0.007), Language use (Z=2.214, p=0.027), and Total score (Z=2.449, p=0.014), with Vocabulary approaching significance (Z=1.951, p≈0.051); Organization (Z=1.548, p=0.122) and Mechanics (Z=1.342, p=0.180) did not show statistically significant changes. The null hypotheses of no median difference were rejected for content, language use, and total writing proficiency, and retained for organization, vocabulary (at the conventional 0.05 level), and mechanics.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Effect sizes calculated as r=Z/√N indicated large effects for Content (r=0.85) and Language use (r=0.70), a moderate effect for Vocabulary (r=0.62), and smaller effects for Organization (r=0.49) and Mechanics (r=0.42), suggesting that ChatGPT-assisted learning had the strongest impact on content development and grammatical language use, moderate impact on vocabulary, and weaker impact on organization and mechanics.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The study notes potential drawbacks of AI-assisted learning from the literature and interpretation of findings, including risks that overreliance on ChatGPT may reduce creativity and critical thinking, possible ethical issues such as data privacy and algorithmic bias, and the observation that the three-week ChatGPT-based intervention did not significantly improve organizational skills or mechanics, raising questions about whether lower-order writing skills may require more direct teacher instruction than AI feedback alone.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "No subgroup analyses by age, gender, first language, or cultural background were conducted; the author recommends that future research explicitly consider these potential confounding variables, but the current small single-group sample did not examine equity or differential effects quantitatively.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Limitations include the very small sample size (N=10) and convenience sampling at a single high school, the short three-week intervention duration, absence of a control group limiting causal attribution, restriction to high school students at CEFR A2–B1 which limits generalizability to other proficiency levels and contexts, use of only one AI platform (ChatGPT-3.5) so findings may not transfer to other tools, and acknowledgment that reliance on limited measures and potential sources of scoring bias should be addressed more rigorously in future research.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges and risks highlighted include the potential for student overreliance on ChatGPT which may undermine creativity and critical thinking, ethical and practical concerns related to data privacy and opaque AI feedback rationales, the need for teacher training to guide responsible and critical use of AI tools, and the difficulty of ensuring that AI-assisted feedback effectively supports lower-order skills such as mechanics and organization without replacing essential teacher-mediated instruction.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future work should employ larger and more diverse samples with longer intervention periods, introduce control or comparison groups to strengthen causal inference, compare ChatGPT with other AI platforms, examine long-term and delayed effects of AI-assisted writing training, investigate differential impacts across proficiency levels and demographic variables (age, gender, first language, cultural background), analyze the affective domain and students’ attitudes towards AI-based writing assistants, and explore ethical implications such as data privacy and algorithmic bias.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The findings support constructivist principles by showing that AI-powered tools like ChatGPT can provide scaffolded, immediate feedback that promotes iterative writing, learner autonomy, and improvements in higher-order aspects of writing such as content development, vocabulary, and language use. Pedagogically, the study suggests that integrating ChatGPT into EFL writing instruction as a supplementary tool can enhance writing proficiency when balanced with human interaction, with teachers using AI feedback during drafting and revision while still providing direct instruction and guidance, particularly for organization and mechanics; curriculum developers are encouraged to design AI-enhanced writing modules that strategically incorporate ChatGPT for brainstorming and revising while preserving spaces for peer review and teacher feedback."
