		"scoring_procedure_and_rater_training (评分流程与评分者培训)": "For both pre-test and post-test, the researcher dictated sentences containing the 50 target words and then manually scored the spelling tests using a rubric where each misspelled word reduced the score by one point from a maximum of 50; tests were paper-based; there is no report of multiple raters or rater training beyond this description."
	},
	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "The study comprised three main sessions: session one pre-test for all students; session two nine hours of instruction (three classes for each group) in which the control group received traditional spelling teaching and the experimental group received LLM-ChatGPT-based training; and session three a post-test administered to both groups using the same 50 target words.",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "ChatGPT (AI Large Language Model, LLM-GPT application developed by OpenAI)",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "Students in the experimental group created individual free accounts in the ChatGPT portal; the customization feature was used with specific instructions such as drilling English language learners on 50 pre-selected commonly misspelled words, restricting students to using only these words, detecting and underlining misspelled target words, giving two chances for correction without supplying the correct spelling, and then providing the correct spelling on the third chance, as well as disabling automatic red underlining in the message box; the specific underlying ChatGPT model version and system parameters (e.g. temperature) were not reported.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students in the experimental group interacted directly with ChatGPT via their own free web-based accounts during in-class training; ChatGPT operated as an external reinforcement tool alongside classroom dictation, responding to student-typed sentences by locating and managing misspelled target words according to the customised instructions.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "The prompting strategy was defined primarily through system-level custom instructions supplied to ChatGPT rather than elaborate student-designed prompts; instructions specified that ChatGPT should restrict responses to 50 predefined words, identify and underline misspelled words, allow two learner attempts to correct each misspelling, refrain from providing correct spellings in feedback for the first two attempts, and then supply the correct spelling on the third attempt; students were instructed to paste or type dictated sentences into ChatGPT and rely on this configured response pattern for spelling practice; no explicit training in advanced prompt engineering techniques (e.g. few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought) was provided.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "In the second session, students in the experimental group were trained on how to open individual free ChatGPT accounts, how to use the program’s facilities, and how to apply the customization function by entering the specified instructions so that the software would respond to their spelling tasks appropriately; no broader training on AI literacy, academic integrity, or critical evaluation of ChatGPT outputs beyond this operational training was reported.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "The intervention unfolded as follows: first, in session one all 60 students completed a paper-based pre-test in which the researcher dictated sentences containing the 50 target words and each misspelled word was scored as −1 from a maximum of 50. In session two (nine hours across three classes for each group), control group students received traditional spelling instruction: the teacher dictated 50 simple sentences each containing one target word and provided spelling feedback directly on students’ papers. Experimental group students were trained to create ChatGPT accounts, configure the custom instructions specifying the list of 50 words and the error-correction procedure, and then use ChatGPT as a writing enhancement tool focused on reducing spelling errors. During the training, the teacher dictated sentences with the 50 words and students entered them into ChatGPT; the software identified misspellings, indicated errors, provided two opportunities for self-correction, and, if needed, supplied the correct spelling on the third trial, functioning as a trial-and-error reinforcement process. In session three, both groups took a post-test using the same content and 50 words to compare spelling performance and evaluate the impact of LLM-ChatGPT versus traditional methods; thereafter, a 20-item questionnaire was administered to the experimental group to collect their perceptions.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Experimental group (N=28) students received training to create and use individual ChatGPT accounts and to configure the LLM with custom instructions to drill 50 frequently misspelled words; they participated in three in-class sessions (total nine hours) where the teacher dictated sentences containing the target words and students typed them into ChatGPT; the application detected and managed misspellings by highlighting errors, allowing two self-correction attempts, and supplying the correct spelling on the third attempt, thereby providing automated feedback, spelling assistance, and regular practice opportunities.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Control group (N=32) students received traditional spelling instruction during the same nine hours, consisting of the teacher dictating sentences containing the 50 target words and providing spelling feedback on the same papers (writing error feedback and correction) without the use of LLM-ChatGPT or other AI tools.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Word- and sentence-level spelling practice during writing tasks; the focus was on mechanical accuracy in spelling within dictated sentences rather than on full-process writing stages such as idea generation, drafting, revising, and editing extended texts.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Simple dictated sentences containing target English words; no extended genre such as essays or paragraphs was used for assessment, only sentence-level dictation tasks.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Paper-based spelling tests and in-class dictation tasks where the teacher dictated simple sentences containing each of the 50 target words and students wrote them (on paper for tests and in ChatGPT for experimental group practice).",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "ChatGPT functioned as a reinforcement and formative feedback tool for spelling: it identified misspelled target words in student-entered sentences, highlighted errors, provided opportunities for corrective attempts, and finally supplied the correct spelling after repeated errors; it did not serve as a scorer of test performance but as an interactive practice and feedback system.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "Researchers and course instructors obtained departmental permission, designed the study, selected the 50 commonly misspelled words, prepared the dictation sentences, dictated the sentences during pre-test, training, and post-test, trained experimental group students to create and use ChatGPT accounts with the specified customization, provided traditional feedback to the control group, administered and scored the pre- and post-tests using a manual rubric, and distributed and collected the questionnaires from the experimental group.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Department of English, Faculty of Languages and Translation at King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia; undergraduate Writing II course in an EFL setting; sessions conducted face-to-face in classrooms with experimental group students accessing ChatGPT online during in-class training.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Researchers adhered to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration; they obtained consent letters from the chairman of the English department to conduct the study on students and obtained oral consent from selected students who were willing to participate; students were assured that their identities would be concealed and their scores used only for research purposes.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Experimental group students were trained to open free ChatGPT accounts that are accessible to all and to use the tool only within the parameters of the study for spelling practice on the 50 target words; pre-test and post-test spelling assessments were strictly paper-based and conducted without ChatGPT, dictionaries, or other digital aids; control group students did not use ChatGPT during the study.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "LLM safety or content filtering settings beyond constraining ChatGPT through custom instructions to focus on the predefined 50 words and spelling tasks were not reported.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Levene’s test confirmed homogeneity between groups at pre-test, suggesting similar baseline spelling performance. Post-test results showed that students in the experimental group who used LLM-ChatGPT for spelling practice scored higher (M=13.81, SD=2.89) than those in the control group who received traditional instruction (M=11.10, SD=1.89), with the t-test indicating a significant difference between groups. The findings indicate that using LLM-ChatGPT as a reinforcement tool had a significant positive impact on enhancing spelling skills and reducing spelling errors compared to traditional methods. Questionnaire results from the experimental group showed generally positive attitudes and perceptions toward ChatGPT, with students reporting that the application was useful in writing courses, helped reduce spelling errors, was easy to use, improved their performance, fit their learning style, and made learning more interesting."

		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Levene’s test on pre-test scores indicated no significant difference in variance between groups (statistic=1.506, p=0.230), suggesting a homogeneous sample at baseline. Independent samples t-test on post-test scores showed that the experimental group using LLM-ChatGPT achieved significantly higher mean scores (M=13.81, SD=2.89) than the control group (M=11.10, SD=1.89), indicating that LLM-ChatGPT had a significant positive effect on spelling performance; specific t and p values are not reported. Descriptive analysis of questionnaire responses showed high mean ratings (mostly above 4 on a 5-point scale) for items related to usefulness, ease of use, and interest, and low means for negatively worded items, indicating statistically untested but clearly positive perceptions.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Effect sizes for group differences (e.g. Cohen’s d) were not reported; only means, standard deviations, and significance of group differences were presented.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The paper discusses potential negative aspects of ChatGPT in general terms, describing it as a double-edged sword that can lead to plagiarism, reduced self-reliance, and negative impacts on human critical thinking if misused; it cites suggestions to control AI use by integrating such software with academic platforms and imposing restrictions to reduce misuse. However, the study itself did not empirically measure misuse or report specific negative outcomes arising from ChatGPT use in this intervention.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "No subgroup analyses (e.g. by gender, proficiency level, or other demographic variables) or equity-related considerations were reported.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "The authors acknowledge several limitations: the study did not examine the impact of using LLM-ChatGPT on enhancing autonomous learning; it used a limited number of target words fed into the software, focusing only on 50 commonly misspelled words rather than spelling in whole texts; it did not measure instructors’ perceptions or attitudes towards using LLM-GPT to minimise spelling errors; and the work was restricted to a specific context of EFL learners in one university department.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Identified challenges and risks include the possibility that misuse of ChatGPT may erode learners’ self-reliance and critical thinking and encourage plagiarism, necessitating institutional control measures such as integrating AI tools with academic platforms and applying restrictions; the need for prerequisite courses to train students in how to use AI tools in learning before they are widely adopted in curricula; and the requirement for ongoing refinement of ChatGPT’s functionality to better align with language learning policies and educational needs.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Suggested directions include investigating the impact of using LLM-ChatGPT on enhancing autonomous learning; extending the use of ChatGPT to drill students on spelling errors in entire texts rather than in a limited word list; examining instructors’ perceptions and attitudes towards using LLM-GPT for minimizing spelling errors among EFL learners; and taking up the general need for more research on AI integration in second language acquisition to leverage AI’s potential while addressing ethical and pedagogical concerns.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study implies that LLM-ChatGPT can effectively serve as a reinforcement learning tool for improving EFL learners’ spelling accuracy by providing automated feedback, spelling assistance, and opportunities for regular practice, and that EFL teachers can integrate such tools into writing instruction to enhance spelling proficiency; it recommends that universities offer prerequisite courses on how to use AI tools in learning so that students can incorporate them responsibly into their study practices; it underscores the importance of designing pedagogical strategies that harness ChatGPT’s benefits while mitigating risks such as plagiarism and overdependence, and suggests that the positive attitudes observed among learners provide a foundation for broader integration of AI-based spelling and writing support across language skills."
