They were then exposed to a modern blended mode incorporating CHAT-OAI (Chat GPT) as a techno-aided quick response generator within project-based professional learning activities, particularly focused on business correspondence (letters, emails, reports, notices, memorandums, office orders, circulars, agenda, minutes of meetings). After this CHAT-OAI-supported phase, a post-recorded test on similar professional writing/ELL content was administered. Open-ended questions were also used to obtain an overview of students' perceptions and feedback on the blended teaching tactics. Statistical analysis compared pre- and post-test performance to assess the impact of CHAT-OAI.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Single treatment group (N=77) received traditional teaching of writing skills and professional business correspondence, followed by a blended phase where CHAT-OAI (Chat GPT) was introduced as a techno-aided tool and quick response generator to support project-based professional learning and to enrich vocabulary and writing quality in tasks such as letters, emails, reports, notices, memorandums, office orders, circulars, agenda and minutes of meetings.",

		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "Teachers provided traditional instruction in writing skills and professional/business correspondence, introduced the blended teaching tactics that incorporated CHAT-OAI, and likely facilitated project-based professional learning; however, specific details on how instructors guided or monitored CHAT-OAI use are not reported.",

Normality tests (KS and SW) indicated non-normal distributions (p<0.05) for both pre- and post-test scores, leading to the use of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (WcS). WcS results revealed 65 positive ranks (post > pre), 8 negative ranks (post < pre), and 4 ties, with z=-6.837, p=0.00, indicating a statistically significant positive change in English language learning after adoption of CHAT-OAI. The computed effect size r≈0.55 was interpreted as a large effect, leading the authors to conclude that CHAT-OAI significantly improves ELL and professional writing outcomes, especially vocabulary enrichment, for most students, while a small subset showed decreased or unchanged performance."

	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Effectiveness was evaluated by comparing pre-recorded and post-recorded test scores for 77 university students on in-house measures of English language learning and professional writing tasks related to business correspondence, using SPSS 26, normality tests (KS, SW), Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and effect size calculations. Results showed that CHAT-OAI-supported project-based professional learning was associated with significantly higher post-test scores and a large effect size (r≈0.55), supporting the conclusion that the techno-aided version of Chat GPT improves English language learning and professional writing skills compared to traditional writing-only approaches.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "In-house pre-recorded and post-recorded tests focused on professional writing topics, including letter writing, email writing, report writing, notices, memorandums, office orders, circulars, agenda, and minutes of meetings; scores analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric statistics; specific scoring rubric or scale descriptors are not reported.",

		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Normality tests (KS and SW) for pre-recorded and post-recorded test scores indicated non-normal distributions with p<0.05, leading to the use of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The WcS results showed a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-test ELL/professional writing scores with z=-6.837 and p=0.00 (2-tailed), leading to rejection of the null hypothesis and acceptance of the alternative that there is a noteworthy positive change in ELL after adoption of CHAT-OAI.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Effect size r was computed from the Wilcoxon z-value using r=Z/√N with N=154 (77 students * 2 time points), resulting in r≈0.55, interpreted by the authors as a large effect size according to Cohen's criteria (0.1 small, 0.3 medium, 0.5 large), indicating a strong positive influence of CHAT-OAI on English language learning and professional writing scores.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The article notes broader concerns that CHAT-OAI is considered a threat by many educationists because assignment material may be a copied version of AI output, that technology can also minimize learning capacity, and that CHAT-OAI cannot provide a holistic overview and comprehensive feedback in the way instructors can. Empirically, 8 of 77 students showed decreased post-test scores and 4 showed no change in ELL after using CHAT-OAI, and these ties and decreases are associated in the discussion with students being less friendly with technology.",

		"limitation (研究局限)": "The study uses a single-group quasi-experimental pre–post design without a separate control group; the sample is limited to 77 university students from one institution; no detailed description of the assessment instrument, scoring criteria, or rater reliability is provided; normality violations required nonparametric analysis; and qualitative perceptions are only briefly mentioned without systematic reporting of themes.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Challenges implied include potential overreliance on AI-generated content, risk of students copying assignments from CHAT-OAI instead of developing their own writing, the limited ability of CHAT-OAI to provide comprehensive feedback comparable to human instructors, and variability in students' technological familiarity, with some students being less friendly with technology and showing no improvement or decreased performance.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "The paper suggests that future generations need to be well equipped to use AI applications optimally with proper reasoning, implying future research and practice should focus on how to train learners to use AI tools responsibly and effectively in language learning and professional writing; more work is needed to refine blended approaches and address ethical and pedagogical issues.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study suggests that technology, specifically Chat GPT (CHAT-OAI), assists in the progression of English language learning and professional writing skills, potentially revolutionizing learners' approaches and polishing their experience with professional presentations. It implies that with a balanced approach, blending traditional pedagogy and AI tools, learners can transform their learning outcomes, gain confident exposure to second language learning, and improve both speaking and writing skills in professional contexts."
