		"sampling_method (抽样方法)": "Convenience sampling of four colleges (60 first year English majors per institution); within each college, two intact classes were assigned to the AI enabled intervention and two to the control condition, yielding 120 students per condition; individual randomisation was not used.",
		"sample_size_and_effect (样本量及效应量)": "Total N=240 first year English majors from four colleges; AI enabled cognitive offload group N=120 and control group N=120. Critical thinking scores: AI group gains +12.3 points (66.3 to 78.6) versus control +0.5 points (65.8 to 66.3); ANCOVA controlling for pretest scores yielded F(1,237)=42.7, p<0.001, partial eta squared≈0.15 (large effect). Essay quality: across logical coherence, evidence use, originality, lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and text cohesion, the AI offload group significantly outperformed control with Cohen’s d ranging approximately from 0.88 to 1.31 (large effects). Mediation analysis showed a significant indirect effect of cognitive offloading on critical thinking gains (ab≈5.98, 95% CI [3.91, 8.17]) alongside a significant direct effect of instruction (c′≈8.67, p<0.001).",
		"theoretical_foundation (理论基础_理论框架)": "Critical thinking frameworks in L2 writing (e.g., Facione’s Delphi definition of interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, explanation, self regulation); cognitive offloading theory and extended mind thesis (external tools functioning as cognitive prosthetics); L2 writing as a form of thinking and locus for critical reflection; research on scaffolded generative AI use in writing instruction; social constructivist perspectives on peer and collaborative learning; metacognitive and active learning principles in AI supported writing pedagogy.",
		"data_collection_instrument (数据收集工具)": "A validated L2 appropriate version of the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal administered as pretest and posttest to measure inference, recognition of assumptions, deduction, interpretation, and evaluation; an essay quality rubric adapted from Paul-Elder elements of thought and empirical L2 writing features (logical connectors, evidence elaboration) with three blind raters scoring logical coherence, evidence use and originality and additional metrics for lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity and text cohesion; a six item Likert type Cognitive Offloading Scale assessing reliance on AI for tasks such as idea generation and lexical choice; qualitative reflection journals documenting offloading decisions and engagement; semi structured interviews; session logs and instructor checklists for fidelity monitoring.",
		"data_collection_validity_reliability (工具信度与效度)": "Critical thinking test reliability: Cronbach’s alpha≈0.89. Essay quality ratings: three blind raters with inter rater alpha≈0.92. Cognitive Offloading Scale: Cronbach’s alpha≈0.90. All scales reported Cronbach’s alpha greater than 0.85. Construct validity of the offloading scale was supported by confirmatory factor analysis with CFI≈0.95 and RMSEA≈0.04. Qualitative trustworthiness was supported through member checking, audit trails, peer debriefing, methodological triangulation, and detailed context descriptions.",
		"data_analysis_method (数据分析方法)": "Quantitative analyses: ANCOVA compared posttest critical thinking scores between groups while controlling for pretest scores; independent samples t tests compared essay quality metrics (logical coherence, evidence use, originality, lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, text cohesion) between AI offload and control groups; mediation analysis using Hayes’ PROCESS macro with bias corrected bootstrap (5,000 samples) tested cognitive offloading as a mediator between instructional condition and critical thinking gains; assumptions of normality, homogeneity and linearity were checked via residual plots and Levene’s test. Analyses were conducted in SPSS 27 and Hayes’ PROCESS. Qualitative analyses: NVivo 12 supported thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke’s six phase approach of familiarisation, coding, theme development, review, definition and reporting, focusing on offloading, engagement and metacognition themes.",
		"unit_of_analysis (分析单位)": "Individual student for critical thinking scores, cognitive offloading scores and qualitative interviews; individual essays for rubric based ratings and linguistic metrics.",
		"group_assignment_method (组别分配方式_随机_非随机等)": "Within each of the four colleges selected via convenience sampling, two intact classes were assigned to the AI enabled cognitive offload intervention and two to the traditional instruction control condition, resulting in 120 students per group; assignment was at class level and described as nonequivalent group quasi experimental rather than fully randomised at the individual level.",
		"power_analysis (功效分析与样本量论证)": "Sample size targets were informed by educational quasi experiment standards of approximately 100–300 participants to detect medium effect sizes around Cohen’s d≈0.50 with 80 percent power at alpha=0.05; a formal a priori power analysis beyond this justification was not reported.",
		"sampling_frame_and_representativeness (抽样框与样本代表性)": "Sampling frame comprised first year English majors from four colleges associated with King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang and related institutions in Thailand; colleges were selected via convenience sampling and classes within them used intact groups, which supports ecological validity in typical L2 writing classrooms but limits representativeness beyond similar Thai English major populations.",
		"scoring_procedure_and_rater_training (评分流程与评分者培训)": "Three blind raters scored essays on coherence, evidence use and originality using an essay quality rubric adapted from Paul-Elder elements and L2 features; inter rater alpha≈0.92 indicates strong agreement.

	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "Twelve week semester long intervention; weekly sessions following a structured four phase writing cycle (AI brainstorming, individual analysis, group revision, reflective journaling) for the AI offload group and a parallel non AI cycle for the control group.",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "ChatGPT (generative AI large language model; specific version NR) used as the primary generative AI tool in the AI enabled cognitive offload condition.",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "Students prompted ChatGPT to generate outlines and other lower order writing outputs during AI brainstorming; details of deployment mode (web interface versus API), model version, and parameter settings were not reported; configuration beyond student prompting and classroom integration NR.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Generative AI was integrated as an external writing aid in classroom instruction; students in the intervention group directly interacted with ChatGPT by entering prompts for brainstorming and revision as part of structured writing cycles, while teachers designed and monitored scaffolds but did not mediate each AI interaction in real time; AI was not embedded into an LMS but used alongside it for essay submission and data collection.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "Structured prompting organised around cognitive offload instruction: in each cycle students used prompts to have ChatGPT generate essay outlines or initial ideas (AI brainstorming), then engaged in individual analysis by critiquing AI suggestions via metacognitive reflection prompts, followed by peer AI co revision workshops where students collaboratively evaluated and modified AI and peer produced text, and completed reflective journaling on offloading decisions; layered prompts such as analysing assumptions, evaluating reasoning and explaining why AI suggestions were accepted or rejected were emphasised to promote analysis, evaluation and reflection rather than uncritical adoption of AI output.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Technology fluency training in this study taught students to craft precise, goal oriented prompts, to clarify rhetorical intentions when interacting with generative AI, and to compare outputs across different AI platforms; metacognitive scaffolds such as reflective journaling and metacognitive reflection prompts around AI suggestions supported awareness of offloading decisions and higher order engagement; students in the intervention group also received guidance on collaborative critique of AI drafts in peer AI co revision workshops; details of session length and explicit AI literacy curricula beyond these descriptions NR.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "Over 12 weeks, the AI enabled cognitive offload group followed a recurring four stage cycle each session: (1) AI brainstorming, where students prompted ChatGPT to generate outlines for English essays; (2) individual analysis, where students critiqued AI suggestions using metacognitive reflection prompts focusing on assumptions, reasoning and quality of ideas; (3) group revision, where peer AI co revision workshops integrated peer feedback and AI suggestions to refine drafts; and (4) reflective journaling, where students recorded their offloading decisions and rationales. The control group followed a parallel sequence of brainstorming, drafting, peer review and reflection without any AI tools, using traditional techniques. Fidelity to the intended instructional sequence was monitored through session logs and instructor checklists.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "The AI enabled cognitive offload group (N=120) participated in a structured generative AI augmented pedagogy where lower order writing tasks were partially delegated to ChatGPT within a 12 week cycle: students used ChatGPT for brainstorming outlines and other routine tasks, then individually analysed AI output through metacognitive prompts, engaged in peer AI co revision workshops combining AI suggestions and peer critique, and maintained reflective journals about their offloading behaviours and engagement; generative AI was explicitly framed as a cognitive prosthetic to support higher order thinking such as analysis, evaluation and reflection rather than as a replacement for these processes.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "The control group (N=120) followed a parallel 12 week writing instruction sequence without access to generative AI, using traditional brainstorming, individual drafting, peer review, and reflection for English essay writing; they engaged in similar tasks and timelines as the intervention group but relied solely on human generated content and feedback.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Multiple stages of the writing process were targeted: AI assisted brainstorming and outlining, individual analysis of AI generated ideas, peer AI co revision of drafts focusing on organisation and argumentation, and reflective journaling on writing and offloading decisions; control group experienced comparable stages without AI.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "English essay writing tasks; essays are described as English essays emphasizing logical coherence, evidence use and originality in critical thinking oriented writing; specific genre label such as argumentative or expository for the study’s tasks is not explicitly reported.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Repeated English essay writing assignments over a 12 week semester administered via the learning management system and supported by weekly structured writing cycles; individual essay topics and lengths beyond being essays suitable for critical thinking assessment are NR.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "Generative AI (ChatGPT) served as a cognitive offloading tool and writing assistant: generating outlines and ideas during brainstorming, automating aspects of lower order writing tasks such as idea generation and surface level drafting, providing content that students then critiqued, modified and integrated into their own writing; it did not function as a grader in this study; its role was to handle routine components so that learners could reallocate cognitive resources to higher order critical thinking during analysis, evaluation and reflection.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "Instructors designed the cognitive offload instructional framework, selected and sequenced activities (AI brainstorming, individual analysis, peer AI co revision, reflective journaling), monitored fidelity through session logs and checklists, facilitated peer review and group discussions, and guided students in metacognitive reflection and technology fluency; they supervised data collection and ensured that the control group followed a comparable but non AI sequence; they did not intervene in each AI interaction but framed and scaffolded AI use pedagogically.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Classroom based instruction in four colleges involving first year English majors at King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang and related institutions in Thailand; sessions were conducted in intact classes using English essay writing tasks and generative AI tools alongside a learning management system in a higher education setting; instruction appears to be primarily face to face with online components for tests and essay submission.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Institutional Review Board review and approval were waived because the study involved routine educational practices with minimal risk and no sensitive personal data; informed consent was obtained from all participants; data are not publicly available due to privacy and ethical restrictions but can be requested from the corresponding author.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Eligibility criteria required that participants had no prior structured AI writing instruction; only the intervention group was allowed to use generative AI (ChatGPT) within the structured cognitive offload cycles, while the control group used no AI; AI use was deliberately scaffolded with metacognitive prompts, peer co revision and reflective journaling to prevent unstructured reliance and cognitive laziness; broader institutional policies on AI use beyond the study context were not reported.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "NR (the article does not specify any technical safety or content filtering settings for ChatGPT beyond pedagogical scaffolds and monitoring of AI use through reflection and instruction).",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Generative AI enabled cognitive offload instruction led to substantially greater critical thinking gains in English essay writing compared with traditional instruction: the AI offload group showed a mean increase of 12.3 points in critical thinking scores versus 0.5 points in the control group, with ANCOVA indicating a highly significant effect and partial eta squared≈0.15 (large). Essays produced by the AI offload group scored significantly higher on logical coherence, evidence use, originality, lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity and text cohesion, with large effect sizes (Cohen’s d around 0.9–1.3). Mediation analysis revealed that cognitive offloading behaviour significantly mediated the relationship between AI enabled instruction and critical thinking gains: AI instruction increased structured offloading, which in turn boosted critical thinking, while a significant direct effect of instruction also remained, indicating partial mediation. Qualitative data supported that structured offloading, metacognitive prompts and peer AI co revision fostered active engagement rather than cognitive laziness, suggesting that when generative AI is integrated through deliberate cognitive offload scaffolding, it can enhance rather than hinder higher order thinking in L2 English writing."
	},
	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "The AI enabled cognitive offload intervention was effective in enhancing both critical thinking and English essay quality compared with traditional instruction. Effectiveness was evaluated using a validated L2 appropriate Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal administered pre and post, an essay quality rubric with multiple dimensions (coherence, evidence use, originality, lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, text cohesion) scored by blind raters, and a Cognitive Offloading Scale combined with mediation analysis. The AI group exhibited large critical thinking gains and substantially higher essay quality across dimensions, whereas the control group showed only minimal critical thinking improvement, indicating strong overall effectiveness of structured generative AI integration.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "Essay quality rubric adapted from Paul-Elder elements of thought and empirical L2 writing indicators, assessing logical coherence, evidence use and originality, with additional quantitative measures for lexical sophistication (type–token ratio and advanced vocabulary use), syntactic complexity (mean clause length and subordinate clause ratio) and text cohesion; three blind raters scored essays on rubric dimensions and linguistic metrics were computed from anonymised texts.",
		"writing_performance_focus (写作表现关注维度_流利度_准确性_复杂度_体裁等)": "Focus on higher level writing quality aspects relevant to critical thinking: logical coherence (systematic argument flow and clear transitions), evidence use (integration and elaboration of supporting details and sources), originality (novelty and distinctiveness of arguments), lexical sophistication (type–token ratio and advanced vocabulary use), syntactic complexity (sentence complexity measures) and text cohesion (discourse organisation and referential ties).",
		"affective_aspect_measure (情感因素测量工具_问卷_量表等)": "NA",
		"affective_aspect_focus (情感因素维度_动机_态度_焦虑_自效感等)": "NA",
		"cognitive_aspect_measure (认知因素测量工具)": "Watson-Glaser style critical thinking test (L2 appropriate version) administered as pretest and posttest; six item Likert type Cognitive Offloading Scale administered after writing tasks to capture reliance on AI for specific tasks; mediation analysis using these measures to model relationships between instruction type, offloading behaviour and critical thinking outcomes.",

		"behavioral_aspect_focus (行为因素维度_使用频率_交互模式_坚持度等)": "Patterns of cognitive offloading to AI, including reliance on ChatGPT for idea generation, lexical selection and surface drafting; how often and in what ways students used AI suggestions in their writing; engagement behaviours such as critiquing AI output, collaborating in peer AI co revision, and reflecting on offloading decisions; how structured offloading behaviour mediated the influence of AI instruction on critical thinking gains.",
		"other_outcomes_measure (其他结果测量工具)": "Mediation analysis using Hayes’ PROCESS macro with bias corrected bootstrapping (5,000 samples) to quantify the indirect effect of cognitive offloading; ANCOVA outputs with partial eta squared; independent samples t tests with Cohen’s d for essay metrics; qualitative thematic analysis of journals and interviews in NVivo 12 to identify themes of offloading, engagement and metacognition.",
		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "Mediating role of cognitive offloading between AI enabled instruction and critical thinking gains; qualitative themes illustrating extended mind use of AI as a cognitive prosthetic, the balance between offload and engagement, and student perceptions of AI supported writing; interplay of social and metacognitive scaffolds with AI offloading processes; broader implications for AI as an integrated component of learners’ cognitive systems.",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Critical thinking pretest at week 1 and posttest at week 12; essays collected at pre and post phases via the learning management system; Cognitive Offloading Scales administered immediately after each writing task; qualitative interviews conducted at mid intervention and post intervention; no delayed follow up after the 12 week period.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Posttest critical thinking scores adjusted for pretest via ANCOVA; essay quality scores on logical coherence, evidence use, originality, lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and text cohesion; critical thinking gains (difference between pretest and posttest); degree of cognitive offloading as mediator.",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Instructional condition (AI enabled cognitive offload instruction versus traditional instruction control) as the main independent variable; cognitive offloading behaviour as a mediator; pretest critical thinking scores as a covariate in ANCOVA; no additional factorial manipulations reported.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "Twelve week intervention with pretest at the beginning of the semester (week 1) and posttest at the end (week 12); no longer term delayed follow up or retention test reported beyond the immediate post intervention assessment.",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "ANCOVA controlling for pretest scores showed a highly significant effect of AI enabled cognitive offload instruction on posttest critical thinking scores, F(1,237)=42.7, p<0.001. The AI offload group’s critical thinking gains (+12.3 points) were significantly larger than the control group’s (+0.5 points). Across essay quality metrics, independent samples t tests revealed significant advantages for the AI offload group in logical coherence (t(238)=10.1, p<0.001), evidence use (t(238)=9.3, p<0.001), originality (t(238)=8.7, p<0.001), lexical sophistication (t(238)=7.5, p<0.001), syntactic complexity (t(238)=6.8, p<0.001) and text cohesion (t(238)=9.8, p<0.001). Mediation analysis showed that the path from condition to offloading (a≈1.45, p<0.001) and from offloading to critical thinking gains (b≈4.12, p<0.001) were both significant, with a significant indirect effect (ab≈5.98, 95% CI [3.91, 8.17]) and a remaining significant direct effect (c′≈8.67, p<0.001), indicating partial mediation.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Partial eta squared for the effect of AI enabled cognitive offload instruction on critical thinking was approximately 0.15, interpreted as a large effect; this implies about 15 percent of the variance in posttest critical thinking scores, after controlling pretest, was attributable to the intervention. Cohen’s d values for essay quality differences between AI offload and control groups ranged from about 0.88 for syntactic complexity to about 1.31 for logical coherence, indicating large effects on multiple dimensions of writing quality. The indirect effect of cognitive offloading in the mediation model was substantial (ab≈5.98 with a confidence interval not including zero), quantifying the contribution of offloading behaviour to critical thinking gains.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The article discusses concerns from prior research that unstructured generative AI use can lead to cognitive laziness and negative correlations between AI reliance and critical thinking when scaffolding is absent, and scepticism about potential cognitive atrophy when too many tasks are delegated to AI; however, in this study, the scaffolded generative AI enabled cognitive offload instruction did not produce cognitive laziness but instead yielded enhanced critical thinking and essay quality. No instances of plagiarism, AI overuse, or other misuse were reported; rather, the structured design with metacognitive prompts and collaborative critique appears to have mitigated common negative effects associated with generative AI use.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "NR (no subgroup analyses by gender, college, proficiency bands or other demographic or equity related variables were reported; the study did not present separate results for different subgroups or discuss fairness issues explicitly).",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "While not presented in a dedicated limitations section, the study notes that previous work often relied on single session lab settings and that its own design, though semester long and classroom based, is confined to first year English majors from four colleges using a nonequivalent groups quasi experimental structure, which limits generalisability and causal inference compared to fully randomised trials; it suggests that future research should replicate the scaffolded cognitive offloading model across diverse educational contexts, examine long term retention of critical thinking gains, and explore additional mediators such as motivation and epistemic beliefs, implicitly acknowledging that duration, context diversity and the range of mediators measured are current constraints.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Challenges and risks highlighted include the danger that unstructured generative AI use may encourage cognitive laziness and over reliance on AI for thinking, the need to design scaffolds that balance cognitive offloading with active engagement and critical evaluation, the practical difficulty of implementing and monitoring a 12 week structured AI enabled instructional sequence in intact classrooms via session logs and checklists, and theoretical concerns about potential cognitive atrophy if AI is used without metacognitive and social supports which this study sought to address through deliberate instructional design.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future work is suggested to replicate the scaffolded generative AI enabled cognitive offloading model across different institutions, disciplines, and learner populations, to investigate long term retention and transfer of critical thinking gains beyond the immediate posttest, to examine additional mediators and moderators such as learner motivation, epistemic beliefs and attitudes toward AI, to compare different generative AI platforms and prompt engineering techniques, and to continue refining balanced offload designs that leverage AI efficiency while strengthening higher order thinking and metacognitive engagement.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "Theoretically, the study contributes to cognitive offloading and extended mind perspectives by demonstrating that generative AI can function as a cognitive prosthetic that enhances, rather than undermines, critical thinking when embedded within structured offload instruction supported by metacognitive prompts and collaborative critique; it also advances L2 writing pedagogy by showing how critical thinking can be fostered through AI augmented writing cycles. Practically, it offers a concrete model for educators to integrate generative AI tools such as ChatGPT into English writing courses through AI brainstorming, individual critique, peer AI co revision and reflective journaling, highlighting the importance of balancing technological efficiency with instructional strategies that promote active engagement, metacognitive reflection and collaborative learning so that essential higher order cognitive skills in L2 English writing are strengthened rather than displaced."
