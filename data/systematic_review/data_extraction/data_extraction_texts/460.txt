		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students directly interacted with ChatGPT-3.5 outside instructor mediation by inputting their own essays with a fixed prompt during an in-class activity; ChatGPT output was used as personalized grammar feedback, and students then wrote their own reflections; ChatGPT was not embedded in the LMS and teachers did not pre-edit AI responses.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "A single, fixed prompt was used for all students and assignments: Correct my grammar.Highlight all changes; the prompt instructed ChatGPT-3.5 to correct grammatical errors and visually highlight all modifications; no additional advanced prompting strategies (such as role prompts or multi-step instructions) are described.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Students were explicitly instructed on the steps for using ChatGPT-3.5 (enter the query, paste the essay, analyze highlighted changes, and compose a reflection paragraph), informed that only the reflection portion would be graded, and warned that submitting the AI-corrected essay or AI-generated reflection would result in a score of 0% for that activity; for the first assignment, students who submitted AI-generated essays were allowed to resubmit a handwritten essay under supervision; broader AI literacy training (e.g., critical evaluation of AI output beyond grammar) was not detailed.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "Students completed four five-paragraph essays over the semester. For each essay-writing cycle: (1) the instructor introduced the essay genre and answered questions for about 30 minutes; (2) students independently selected essay topics and began writing; (3) for approximately two weeks, students participated in in-class, student-led writing workshops in assigned groups, providing each other feedback on translation, grammar, and structure while the instructor facilitated and posed guiding questions; (4) students were explicitly forbidden to use AI tools during the writing workshops; (5) in the final class of each two-week cycle, students used ChatGPT-3.5 with the prompt Correct my grammar.Highlight all changes to obtain personalized grammar corrections for their essays; (6) students analyzed ChatGPT’s highlighted changes, categorized general error patterns, and wrote a reflection paragraph explaining the types of grammatical errors and how they would use this feedback to improve future writing; (7) students submitted three separate documents (original essay, ChatGPT output, reflection) on BlackBoard, with only the reflection contributing to participation points.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "All 95 students in the course received the same inquiry-based instruction and were required to participate in four cycles of AI-administered personalized grammar feedback using ChatGPT-3.5 followed by reflective writing; engagement was operationalized by whether students submitted genuinely human-written reflections for at least half of the assignments.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "NA",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "ChatGPT-3.5 was used after students had drafted their essays during the two-week workshop period, at the revision and editing stage, to correct grammar and highlight changes; students then reflected on these corrections to inform future writing.",

		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Inquiry-based EFL academic essay writing tasks requiring students to select topics, develop thesis statements, supporting sentences, and conclusions, and write structured essays in English, followed by AI-supported grammar correction and reflective writing on personalized feedback.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "ChatGPT-3.5 functioned as a grammar feedback provider, generating corrected versions of student essays with all grammatical changes highlighted to indicate personalized error patterns; the LLM did not assign grades but provided automated, AI-administered personalized feedback for student reflection.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "The instructor designed and taught the inquiry-based written communications course, introduced essay genres, assigned and facilitated in-class student-led writing workshops, monitored group work, posed guiding questions instead of directly answering language queries, set up the ChatGPT-3.5 exercise and academic integrity guidelines, graded reflection assignments as participation, evaluated the handwritten final exam essay and grammar sub-score, and enforced penalties (0% for AI-generated submissions) to discourage misuse of AI.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "English-medium university in Saudi Arabia; introductory written communications course using inquiry-based learning; essays were written and submitted digitally during the semester, while the final exam essay was handwritten; instruction took place in face-to-face classes with use of an online learning platform (BlackBoard) for submissions.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "The paper does not report formal institutional ethical approval or informed consent procedures; it describes academic integrity policies such as awarding 0% for assignments where AI-generated essays matched submissions and allowing a supervised handwritten resubmission for the first assignment.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Students were explicitly directed not to use AI tools, paraphrasing programs, or translation applications during the in-class writing workshop periods and were informed that the final exam would be handwritten and must be completed without technological aids; AI use was restricted to a structured in-class exercise at the end of each writing cycle where students were allowed to input their essays into ChatGPT-3.5 with the fixed grammar-correction prompt, and they were instructed to implement only grammatical changes, not to submit the AI-generated essay as their own work.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "Academic integrity safeguards included warnings that a 100% match between the AI-generated corrected essay and the submitted assignment would result in a grade of 0% for that essay; for the first assignment, students who submitted AI-generated essays were allowed to resubmit handwritten essays under instructor supervision; no additional technical content filters or automated safety settings specific to ChatGPT are described.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Engagement with the ChatGPT-based reflection activity, defined as submitting human-written reflections on AI-generated personalized grammar feedback, was significantly correlated with higher scores on the handwritten final exam essay and its grammar sub-section, whereas mere class attendance was not related to these outcomes. Only 35% of students completed at least half of the four reflection assignments correctly (with human-generated reflections), while 65% submitted only AI-generated output. The findings suggest that AI-administered personalized feedback via ChatGPT-3.5 can support improvements in EFL learners’ essay writing and grammar in an inquiry-based learning class, but only when learners actively engage in the associated critical-thinking and self-regulated reflection tasks, rather than relying passively on AI or simply attending class."

		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "A paired-samples t-test showed that class attendance and engagement with the ChatGPT reflection activity differed significantly [t(94)=50.76, p≤0.000]; engagement with the ChatGPT reflection activity was significantly correlated with both final exam handwritten essay grade (r=0.46, p≤0.000) and grammar sub-score (r=0.28, p≤0.000), whereas class attendance was not significantly correlated with essay grade (r=0.13) or grammar sub-score (r=0.16).",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Correlations indicate a moderate positive association between engagement with the ChatGPT-based reflection activity and overall handwritten essay performance (r=0.46) and a smaller but positive association with the grammar sub-score (r=0.28); attendance showed small, non-significant associations with essay (r=0.13) and grammar (r=0.16) grades.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "A substantial portion of students (65%) did not complete the required human-written reflections and instead submitted only AI-generated output, indicating misuse of ChatGPT-3.5 and avoidance of the intended self-regulated reflection; some students initially attempted to submit AI-generated essays as their own work, resulting in 0% grades when a 100% match was detected; the study discusses the risk that grade-oriented students may focus on minimal effort and rely on AI outputs rather than engaging in critical thinking and SRL.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "The sample consisted exclusively of female Saudi Arabian EFL students who were native Arabic speakers with moderate to competent English proficiency; the author notes that results cannot be generalized to male EFL students with similar backgrounds, but no within-study subgroup analyses (e.g., by engagement level and demographic variables) are reported.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Limitations include the relatively small sample size (N=95), the restriction to female native Arabic speakers at a single English-medium university, the absence of male participants, the lack of direct measures of learning orientation or attitudes toward writing and feedback, and the fact that only correlations rather than causal effects can be inferred; the study did not examine changes in writing performance across the four AI-based SRL activities or analyze the content of ChatGPT-3.5 feedback beyond its role in grammar correction.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Key implementation challenges include low engagement with the self-regulated reflection activity (only 35% of students submitted human-generated reflections for at least half of the assignments), the tendency of many students to submit AI-generated reflections or essays despite clear instructions, the difficulty of motivating grade-oriented students when SRL activities contribute only a small percentage of the course grade, and the need to manage academic integrity concerns while integrating AI-generated feedback in an inquiry-based EFL writing course.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future work should increase sample size and include male students and more diverse populations to improve generalizability, investigate students’ learning orientations and attitudes toward writing and feedback before and after repeated SRL activities with AI-generated feedback, and further explore the benefits and costs of implementing SRL AI-based exercises in inquiry-based EFL writing courses, including how generative AI activities affect long-term critical thinking and writing development.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study suggests that AI-administered personalized grammar feedback via ChatGPT-3.5 may enhance EFL essay writing and grammar only when paired with structured, critical-thinking reflection tasks that promote self-regulated learning; simply providing AI feedback or ensuring high attendance is insufficient. For teaching practice, instructors should design AI-based activities that require students to actively analyze and explain AI feedback and may need to adjust grading policies and motivational strategies to encourage genuine engagement while addressing academic integrity and over-reliance on AI."
