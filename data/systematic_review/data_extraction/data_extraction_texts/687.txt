Session 1 involved a writing pre-test: students had one hour to write at least 200 words on a topic aligned with course content, with preparatory activities like questioning and brainstorming. Sessions 2–3 introduced and modeled the process-based writing framework and showed students how to use GPT-based chatbots during pre-writing, writing, and post-writing. In sessions 4–9, students completed four composition assignments (quizzes) on topics parallel in difficulty and aligned with their writing class. In the writing stage, students collaborated with peers, used GPT-based chatbots to generate and confirm ideas, ensure grammatical and structural accuracy, make comparisons, and develop argumentative details, while the teacher was available for questions. In the post-writing stage, they used a revision checklist with GPT-based chatbot assistance to check coherence, completeness, and resolve lexical and organizational issues, and then an editing checklist to identify and correct minor errors, again with chatbot support. Session 10 was the post-writing test, where students wrote at least 200 words in 60 minutes on a new but parallel topic; revision and editing checklists were available but their use was optional and strategies were not explicitly prompted.",

		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Quantitatively, students’ overall writing performance improved significantly after the intervention: pre-writing test mean=9.13 (SD=2.619) versus post-writing test mean=17.03 (SD=2.917), with a paired t-test showing t=11.014, p=0.001 (p<0.05), indicating a marked positive impact of integrating GPT-based chatbots within a process-based writing framework. Across four writing quizzes, overall scores and component scores for organization, content, coherence-cohesion, and argumentation increased progressively from Quiz 1 to Quiz 4, while logical connection declined slightly in Quizzes 2 and 3 before rebounding strongly in Quiz 4; repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of quiz (F=97.115, p<0.001, partial eta squared≈0.781), and pairwise comparisons showed that Quiz 1 scores were significantly lower than those of the other quizzes. Qualitatively, students reported that the process-based approach plus GPT-based chatbots helped them establish a strong foundation through planning and clustering, boosted their confidence via collaboration, and empowered them to take control of their writing through revising and editing. They perceived GPT-based chatbots as beneficial for writing practice, immediate feedback, and reducing anxiety in a low-pressure practice environment, and they highlighted gains in content, organization, coherence, and argumentation; however, they also experienced challenges such as time constraints for fully implementing all writing stages, misunderstandings due to inaccurate AI responses, overreliance on AI that hindered independent idea formulation, and insufficiently detailed and personalized feedback compared with human teachers."
