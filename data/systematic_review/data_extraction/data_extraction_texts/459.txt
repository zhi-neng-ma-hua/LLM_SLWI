		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Students in the experimental group who used AI tools, mainly ChatGPT-3, showed significantly greater improvement in overall writing performance from pre-test to post-test compared with the control group, with a large effect size for overall scores. AI tools had significant positive effects at all three writing stages, with the largest effect for the post-writing stage, followed by drafting and then pre-writing. AI-supported students generated more ideas, had access to a wider range of vocabulary and structured factual outlines, and used AI to paraphrase and restructure their essays during post-writing, which led to substantial gains in revision and editing quality. The results indicate that AI tools can effectively enhance EFL learners’ writing across the process, particularly in post-writing and drafting stages, while pre-writing benefits may depend on explicit training in using AI for planning."
	},
	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Effectiveness of AI tools was evaluated using a pre-post essay writing test scored with an analytic rubric across three writing stages; results showed that the experimental group using AI tools significantly outperformed the control group on overall post-test writing performance, with large effect sizes, and scored significantly higher at each stage (pre-writing, drafting, post-writing), indicating that AI-integrated tools substantially enhanced writing performance.",

		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "No statistically significant difference between groups at pre-test (experimental M=3.82, SD=1.78; control M=3.81, SD=1.86; t(43)=0.015, p=0.98). At post-test, the experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group on overall writing performance (text reports experimental M=22.47, SD=3.30; control M=13.45, SD=5.11; t(43)=7.072, p<.001). Stage-specific post-test comparisons also favored the experimental group, with significant differences in pre-writing scores (t(43)=3.59, p=.001), drafting scores (t(43)=2.32, p=.025), and post-writing scores (t(43)=11.70, p<.001).",

		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The study did not report observed misuse or negative learning outcomes directly associated with AI use in the experimental group; however, in the literature review, the authors discuss potential risks identified in previous research, including overreliance on AI that may deprive learners of essential learning experiences and critical thinking opportunities, concerns about authorship and plagiarism, threats to academic honesty and educational equity, and possible issues with AI tools’ exactness and representation of the social nature of writing.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "The article references prior work that AI tools can pose threats to educational equity, but within this study no subgroup analyses (e.g., by gender, proficiency level, or other demographics) were conducted and no equity-related empirical findings were reported.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "The study focused on essay writing, including compare-and-contrast essays, and did not examine how AI effectiveness might differ across essay types in detail; it did not investigate students’ perceptions of AI use at each stage; the post-writing stage was treated as a single composite phase that merged revision, editing, and proofreading rather than analyzing each sub-stage separately; only one AI tool (ChatGPT) was used; the sample size was relatively small and drawn from a single institution and course, limiting the generalizability of the findings.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Challenges include that AI tools were less effective at the pre-writing stage compared with drafting and post-writing, possibly because students need explicit training on how to interact with AI for brainstorming and planning; students may underestimate the importance of pre-writing and thus underuse AI support at this stage; there is a risk of overreliance on AI-generated structures and language, especially during post-writing where ChatGPT can paraphrase and restructure whole essays; and, as highlighted in the literature review, broader challenges include maintaining academic honesty, avoiding plagiarism, and ensuring that AI use does not undermine the development of learners’ independent writing and critical thinking skills.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research should examine the impact of AI tools on different types of essays (e.g., descriptive, narrative, comparative, argumentative) individually, explore students’ perceptions of AI tool use at each writing stage, disaggregate the post-writing stage into sub-stages such as revision, editing, and proofreading to evaluate AI effectiveness more precisely, investigate the effects of different AI tools rather than only ChatGPT, and extend the research to larger and more diverse samples and educational settings to enhance generalizability.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The findings suggest that integrating AI tools, particularly ChatGPT, into writing instruction can significantly enhance EFL students’ writing performance, especially in the drafting and post-writing stages where AI can provide immediate, personalized feedback on grammar, vocabulary, organization, coherence, and cohesion; writing assessment practices should be adapted to evaluate the entire writing process (including outlining, drafting, and final drafts) rather than only the final product; teachers can incorporate AI support strategically in pre-writing, drafting, and post-writing activities to scaffold students’ writing while guiding them to develop critical judgment about when and how AI assistance is most effective and to avoid overreliance."
