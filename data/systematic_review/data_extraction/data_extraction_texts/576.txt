	},
	"Methodology": {
		"research_design (研究设计_实验_准实验_纵向等)": "Quasi-experimental mixed-method design with pre- and post-achievement tests (two pre-tests averaged to a single pre-score and one post-test) and a comparison between a ChatGPT-integrated experimental group and a traditionally taught control group, complemented by qualitative semi-structured interviews.",
		"research_method (研究方法_定量_定性_混合)": "Mixed-methods (quantitative quasi-experimental with non-parametric statistics plus qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews).",
		"sampling_method (抽样方法)": "Cluster random sampling of intact classes; two intact 10th grade classes at an Anatolian high school in Bahcelievler, Istanbul were selected and assigned as experimental group and control group.",
		"sample_size_and_effect (样本量及效应量)": "Total N=66; experimental group (EG) N=33 (F=20, M=13), control group (CG) N=33 (F=18, M=15). Quantitatively, both groups improved in writing and vocabulary, but Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests showed significant pre–post gains only for the control group in writing (z=-3.969, p=.001) and vocabulary (z=-3.775, p=.001), while the experimental group’s gains were not statistically significant for writing (z=-1.630, p=.103) or vocabulary (z=-1.744, p=.081). Mann–Whitney U tests indicated no statistically significant differences between EG and CG on pre- or post-writing scores (pre: U=484.500, p=.438; post: U=444.000, p=.195) or pre- or post-vocabulary scores (pre: U=420.000, p=.110; post: U=517.500, p=.727).",
		"theoretical_foundation (理论基础_理论框架)": "Framed within a pragmatic worldview in mixed-methods research, prioritizing understanding the research problem over strict adherence to a single methodology; grounded in literature on ChatGPT as a generative AI tool in language learning, AI-based chatbots in ELT, and technology-enhanced language learning, with attention to issues of motivation, autonomy, academic integrity, and human–AI complementarity.",
		"data_collection_instrument (数据收集工具)": "Two pre-achievement exams and one post-achievement exam, each including a vocabulary section (50 points; vocabulary items from textbook Themes such as Plans, Legendary Figure, Traditions, Travel) and a writing section (two paragraph-writing tasks totaling 50 points), prepared by the researcher with assistance from ChatGPT; a paragraph assessment scale (paragraph assessment rubric) for scoring writing; and a semi-structured interview protocol adapted from Xiao and Zhi (2023) for eliciting experimental-group students’ perceptions of ChatGPT-integrated English lessons.",
		"data_collection_validity_reliability (工具信度与效度)": "Achievement exam questions and the paragraph assessment scale were reviewed and agreed upon by the researcher, two English teacher colleagues at the same school, and an ELT academic expert to establish content validity and reliability; semi-structured interview questions were adapted from a published study and audio-recorded, transcribed using Transkriptor, and thematically analyzed by both researchers to ensure interpretive consistency.",
		"data_analysis_method (数据分析方法)": "Quantitative data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 29. Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, significance values) were computed; skewness and kurtosis values indicated non-normal distributions, so non-parametric tests were used: Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests for within-group pre–post comparisons and Mann–Whitney U tests for between-group comparisons of pre- and post-scores. Qualitative interview data were transcribed and examined via thematic analysis using MaxQDA24, with coding conducted by both researchers and themes organized around perceived strengths, obstacles, and correct usage of ChatGPT.",

		"sampling_frame_and_representativeness (抽样框与样本代表性)": "Sampling frame consisted of 10th grade students at an Anatolian high school in Bahcelievler, Istanbul; participants were from two intact classes and may not be representative of other grades, schools, or regions; the authors suggest that similar studies with larger and more diverse samples are needed.",
		"scoring_procedure_and_rater_training (评分流程与评分者培训)": "Writing sections of the achievement exams were scored using a paragraph assessment scale developed by the researcher and colleagues and validated by an ELT academic; specific details of rater training procedures and inter-rater reliability coefficients are not reported, but the rubric-based scoring was jointly reviewed and agreed upon by the researcher, two English teachers, and an expert."
	},
	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "Implementation phase lasted 3 weeks within an overall 5-week study; the experimental group used ChatGPT during 6 in-class sessions (each a 40-minute lesson hour) for vocabulary and writing activities across Themes 4 and 5, plus a pilot session before implementation; pre-tests were conducted in Week 1 and post-test and interviews in Week 5.",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "ChatGPT (OpenAI generative AI chatbot; specific model version not specified).",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "NR",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students in the experimental group interacted directly with ChatGPT during in-class vocabulary and writing tasks, using their own devices under teacher monitoring; ChatGPT was integrated as a central instructional tool for those sessions, while the teacher mainly monitored rather than delivering traditional explanations.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "Students were explicitly taught how to enter prompts when doing vocabulary exercises and writing paragraphs in English; a pilot study revealed difficulties in writing appropriate prompts, leading the researcher to instruct students in writing more detailed and accurate prompts (e.g., specifying level, task type, and needed examples) to obtain more relevant outputs; beyond this training in detailed prompting, no formal prompt-engineering framework was reported.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Before implementation, the experimental group received a presentation explaining what ChatGPT is, how to use it, and how to write prompts for vocabulary and paragraph-writing tasks; a pilot study allowed them to practice using ChatGPT and helped identify and address problems with prompt formulation; this preparatory training was designed to prevent time loss and to equip students with basic AI literacy for the intervention.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "In the pre-implementation phase, both EG and CG completed two pre-achievement exams; the experimental group then attended a ChatGPT introduction and pilot practice. During the implementation phase, in six separate sessions, the EG completed vocabulary activities for Themes 4 and 5 (e.g., fill-in-the-blanks, definition matching, synonym/antonym matching) and related paragraph-writing tasks using ChatGPT for assistance, while the CG completed parallel vocabulary and writing activities via traditional instruction without ChatGPT. In later sessions, the EG used ChatGPT for overall vocabulary review and overall writing activities covering both themes, again with the CG performing similar tasks traditionally. In the post-implementation phase, both groups took a post-achievement exam, and seven EG students participated in semi-structured interviews about their ChatGPT experiences.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "ChatGPT-integrated vocabulary and writing instruction over six 40-minute sessions: vocabulary exercises (fill-in-the-blanks, definition matching, synonym/antonym matching) and paragraph-writing activities aligned with textbook Themes 4 ‘Traditions’ and 5 ‘Travel’, conducted with ChatGPT assistance for generating examples, explanations, and feedback; students were encouraged to use ChatGPT as a personal learning assistant during these tasks after receiving training on prompts.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Traditional vocabulary and writing instruction with the same content (Themes 4 and 5), tasks, and schedule but without access to ChatGPT; the teacher taught vocabulary and guided writing activities in a conventional classroom manner across the same six sessions.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "ChatGPT was primarily used during the idea generation and drafting stages of paragraph writing (e.g., obtaining example paragraphs, asking for topic-related vocabulary, and seeing model texts) and also for feedback and correction on students’ written paragraphs, including grammar and vocabulary; the study did not separately track multiple revision cycles, but students reported using ChatGPT to rewrite and improve their paragraphs.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Short paragraph writing aligned with the 10th grade coursebook, including topics and themes such as plans, legendary figures (pre-tests), and traditions and travel (post-test); genres focus on basic paragraph development rather than full essays.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Two-paragraph writing tasks in each achievement exam (e.g., write a paragraph of a specified length related to textbook themes and using taught vocabulary); in-class writing activities where students wrote paragraphs assisted by ChatGPT in the experimental group or via traditional methods in the control group.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "ChatGPT functioned as a generative learning assistant and feedback provider: it supplied example paragraphs, suggested vocabulary and sentence structures, provided definitions and sample sentences, corrected language errors when asked, and offered explanations of grammar and word usage; it did not assign grades or function as an automatic scoring engine.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "The teacher designed and implemented the intervention, prepared and validated the assessment instruments and paragraph assessment scale, introduced and trained the experimental group in using ChatGPT, and facilitated and monitored classroom activities; in ChatGPT-integrated sessions, the teacher allowed students to interact with ChatGPT individually while supervising, whereas in control sessions the teacher provided traditional instruction and feedback.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Face-to-face English classes in two intact 10th grade classes at an Anatolian high school in Bahcelievler, Istanbul, Türkiye; ChatGPT was used as an in-class digital tool, with activities aligned to the national English curriculum.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Parental consent for student participation was obtained before the implementation began; official procedures for conducting the research at the school were followed; interviews were audio-recorded with participant consent; no separate institutional ethics committee approval statement is reported.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "The experimental group was explicitly allowed and encouraged to use ChatGPT during designated vocabulary and writing sessions as part of English class activities; the control group did not use ChatGPT in class; the study notes that students needed guidance to avoid improper use such as copying and pasting entire ChatGPT outputs, but detailed written AI use policies are not described.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "NR",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Both the ChatGPT-integrated experimental group and the traditionally taught control group showed improvement in writing and vocabulary scores from pre-test to post-test, but statistically significant gains were observed only in the control group, and between-group comparisons revealed no significant differences, suggesting that, within this short 6-lesson-hour intervention, traditional instruction had a stronger measurable impact on writing skill and vocabulary development than ChatGPT-integrated instruction alone. Qualitative results indicated that students perceived ChatGPT positively as a practical, individualized learning assistant that supports writing and vocabulary learning, provides rapid and detailed feedback, enhances autonomy, and is generally considered reliable, while also expressing concerns about academic integrity, laziness, and dependence on the tool."
	},
	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Effectiveness was evaluated through two pre-achievement exams and one post-achievement exam, each containing vocabulary and writing components, scored with a validated paragraph assessment scale, as well as through semi-structured interviews with seven experimental-group students analyzed thematically; quantitatively, both groups improved but the control group showed statistically significant gains in writing and vocabulary whereas the experimental group did not, and between-group differences were not statistically significant, indicating that in this implementation ChatGPT-integrated instruction did not outperform traditional teaching; qualitatively, students reported that ChatGPT meaningfully supported their learning, writing, and vocabulary development.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "Pre-achievement exams (two) and post-achievement exam including paragraph-writing tasks scored out of 50 points for writing using a paragraph assessment scale developed by the researcher and colleagues and validated by an ELT expert; scale details are in Appendix C but described generally as assessing paragraph quality in line with textbook-based expectations.",
		"writing_performance_focus (写作表现关注维度_流利度_准确性_复杂度_体裁等)": "Overall paragraph writing performance including appropriate structure and organization of paragraphs, use of taught vocabulary, grammatical accuracy, and general coherence and content relevance; specific analytic sub-dimensions (e.g., fluency vs complexity) are not separated in the reported statistics.",
		"affective_aspect_measure (情感因素测量工具_问卷_量表等)": "Semi-structured interviews conducted in Turkish with seven experimental-group students at the end of the implementation; interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed using Transkriptor, and coded thematically with MaxQDA24 to explore perceptions of ChatGPT-integrated English lessons.",
		"affective_aspect_focus (情感因素维度_动机_态度_焦虑_自效感等)": "Students’ attitudes toward ChatGPT (e.g., seeing it as a powerful, practical learning partner and information provider), perceived impact on motivation and autonomy (e.g., feeling more independent, able to study on their own, and prepared for speaking and writing tasks), and concerns about reduced effort, laziness, and academic integrity; also perceptions of reliability and trust in ChatGPT’s answers.",
		"cognitive_aspect_measure (认知因素测量工具)": "Thematic analysis of interview data focusing on students’ descriptions of how they used ChatGPT to understand input, derive rules and patterns from examples, and obtain explanations; no separate cognitive tests or questionnaires were administered.",
		"cognitive_aspect_focus (认知因素维度_策略使用_元认知监控等)": "Awareness of how to use ChatGPT for learning (recognizing the importance of writing detailed and appropriate prompts, checking reliability through comparison with other sources), metacognitive reflection about correct vs incorrect usage (e.g., not simply copying and pasting outputs), understanding of grammar and vocabulary through examples and explanations, and recognition that ChatGPT is a tool that needs to be used in combination with human judgment and traditional learning.",
		"behavioral_aspect_measure (行为因素测量工具_日志_平台日志等)": "Students’ reported behaviors and usage patterns captured in semi-structured interviews (e.g., frequency and nature of using ChatGPT for homework, speaking exam preparation, vocabulary practice, and paragraph writing); no automated usage logs or observational coding schemes were reported.",
		"behavioral_aspect_focus (行为因素维度_使用频率_交互模式_坚持度等)": "Use of ChatGPT for individualized study (e.g., generating examples, checking paragraphs, preparing for speaking exams), reliance on ChatGPT for fast answers and corrections, attempts to adjust prompts and specify level to obtain more tailored outputs, and instances where students or their peers used ChatGPT to do entire assignments by copying and pasting, indicating both productive and potentially problematic usage patterns.",
		"other_outcomes_measure (其他结果测量工具)": "NR",
		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "NR",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Two pre-achievement exams administered in Week 1 (pre-test and pre-achievement-2), averaged to create a single pre-score per student; one post-achievement exam administered in Week 5 after the completion of six ChatGPT-integrated or traditional lessons; no delayed follow-up test was conducted.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Writing achievement scores (paragraph-writing component) and vocabulary achievement scores (vocabulary component) from the averaged pre-achievement exams and the post-achievement exam.",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Type of instruction (ChatGPT-integrated English teaching in the experimental group vs traditional instruction in the control group) and time (pre-test composite vs post-test); at the qualitative level, type of exposure to ChatGPT (in-class structured use) served as the key differentiating factor.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Within-group analyses using Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests showed no statistically significant difference between pre- and post-writing scores in the experimental group (z=-1.630, p=.103> .05), but a significant improvement in the control group’s writing scores (z=-3.969, p=.001< .05). For vocabulary, the experimental group’s pre–post difference was not significant (z=-1.744, p=.081> .05), whereas the control group’s vocabulary scores improved significantly (z=-3.775, p=.001< .05). Mann–Whitney U tests revealed no statistically significant differences between EG and CG for pre-writing (U=484.500, p=.438) or post-writing (U=444.000, p=.195) nor for pre-vocabulary (U=420.000, p=.110) or post-vocabulary (U=517.500, p=.727), indicating similar performance levels between groups at both time points despite traditional instruction showing stronger within-group gains.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Effect sizes (e.g., Cohen’s d, r) are not explicitly reported; only p-values, z-scores, and rank information for non-parametric tests are provided, so the magnitude of the ChatGPT-integrated instruction effect relative to traditional instruction cannot be quantified from the article.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "Students expressed concerns that ChatGPT could facilitate academic dishonesty and plagiarism when users simply copy and paste its outputs as their own work, and noted that ChatGPT does not provide bibliographic information or explicit sources, which complicates proper citation. They also warned that heavy reliance on ChatGPT might cause laziness, reduce personal cognitive effort, and lead students to let ChatGPT do all the work, possibly undermining genuine learning; technical limitations (e.g., lack of support or display issues on some phones) were also mentioned as practical drawbacks.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "No subgroup analyses (e.g., by gender, initial proficiency, or other demographic characteristics) are reported, and equity-related issues such as differential access to suitable devices or the Internet are only indirectly mentioned through comments on technical limitations; authors do not provide detailed subgroup statistics or equity-focused discussion.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Limitations include the focus on only one grade level (10th graders) from a single Anatolian high school, a relatively short intervention period of six lesson hours, a modest sample size of 66 students, and potential influence of unmeasured variables such as anxiety, intrinsic motivation, tiredness, and cognitive overload on test scores; only writing skill and vocabulary development were examined, leaving other language skills unexplored; absence of delayed follow-up makes it difficult to assess long-term effects; and use of intact classes without controlling for all extraneous variables may limit the strength of causal claims.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges and risks noted or implied include the need for teachers to be familiar with and positively disposed toward AI tools (many teachers had never mentioned ChatGPT before), the necessity of training students to use ChatGPT properly and write effective prompts, potential technical issues such as device compatibility and font display problems, the risk that ChatGPT-centred instruction with reduced teacher explanation may be less effective than traditional instruction, and ongoing concerns about academic integrity, ethical use, and student over-reliance on AI.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "The authors suggest conducting ChatGPT-integrated English teaching studies with other age groups and larger, more diverse samples; extending the intervention duration to better observe the tool’s impact; including additional variables such as anxiety, motivation, autonomy, and engagement; investigating the effects of ChatGPT on other language skills beyond writing and vocabulary; and designing further experimental research to examine how ChatGPT can be combined with other instructional strategies rather than used as a stand-alone instructional centre.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study implies that ChatGPT should be viewed as an assistant rather than a replacement for teachers, supporting traditional instruction rather than supplanting it; it highlights that ChatGPT can act as a practical learning partner, providing personalized examples and immediate feedback that may boost autonomy and motivation, but also that human teachers and pedagogical strategies remain crucial for sustained skill development. Pedagogically, the authors recommend in-service AI and technology training for teachers, explicit instruction for students on how to use ChatGPT ethically and effectively, and curriculum integration that positions AI tools as supplemental aids while preserving teacher–student interaction and critical thinking in language learning."
