In Substitution, they installed Cami as a WhatsApp add-on, received writing prompts via WhatsApp, and sent prompts to Cami, substituting paper-based materials and printed dictionaries with AI-based prompts and translation. In Augmentation, they developed descriptive writing outlines in Cami, requested idea suggestions and vocabulary/grammar feedback, and practiced generating images via /imagine commands. In Modification, they chatted with Cami as a personal teacher to get guidance on writing descriptive texts, asked for feedback and grammar checking via text or voice prompts, and shared experiences with classmates on operating Cami efficiently. In Redefinition, students created images as the basis for new descriptive texts, composed descriptive texts from those images, asked Cami for feedback on both image and text so Cami could check their appropriateness, and then sent their compositions to the class WhatsApp group.
