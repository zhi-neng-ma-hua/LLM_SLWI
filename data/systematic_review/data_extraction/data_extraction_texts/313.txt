		"sampling_method (抽样方法)": "Convenience sampling of 31 third-year English majors in an advanced English course at one university in north China.",
		"sample_size_and_effect (样本量及效应量)": "Total N=31 EFL university students. Independent t-tests comparing baseline and intervention scores showed significant improvements (p<.05) in content, organization, vocabulary, accuracy, mechanics, and total score. Comparisons between baseline and follow-up scores showed significant improvements in content, vocabulary, accuracy, mechanics, and overall score, but no significant difference in organization. MANOVA indicated that baseline writing proficiency had a highly significant multivariate effect on the combined five dimensions (Pillai’s Trace=0.875, F=77.038, df=5,55, p<.001, partial eta squared=0.875) and the AI intervention also had a highly significant multivariate effect (Pillai’s Trace=0.675, F=22.872, df=5,55, p<.001, partial eta squared=0.675).",
		"theoretical_foundation (理论基础_理论框架)": "Grounded in second language acquisition views of writing as a complex skill with multiple dimensions (content, organization, vocabulary, grammar, mechanics) and in emerging research on generative AI chatbots in EFL writing, with a focus on how iterative AI feedback can enhance writing outcomes and how baseline proficiency and AI intervention jointly shape development; the repeated-measures design is motivated by its efficiency in controlling inter-individual differences and increasing statistical power.",
		"data_collection_instrument (数据收集工具)": "Timed in-class English writing tasks (30-minute compositions) collected during baseline, intervention, and follow-up phases; analytic writing rating rubric with five dimensions (content, organization, vocabulary, grammatical accuracy, mechanics) adapted from scales by Li et al.; weighted total writing score combining the five dimensions; TEM-4 scores used to index proficiency and form high- and low-proficiency groups; semi-structured interview protocol with three main questions on DeepSeek’s impact, advantages over regular writing, and challenges during DeepSeek-assisted writing practice.",
		"data_collection_validity_reliability (工具信度与效度)": "The five-dimension rubric was clearly defined, with content assessing relevance and appropriateness of argument to topic, organization assessing fluency and coherence, vocabulary assessing range and appropriateness, accuracy assessing grammatical correctness, and mechanics assessing spelling, punctuation, and capitalization; each dimension had a maximum score of 10 and the overall score was a weighted sum (content 30 percent, organization 20 percent, vocabulary 20 percent, accuracy 20 percent, mechanics 10 percent). Two experienced teachers rated the writings; when scores for any dimension differed by 3 points or more, a third rater mediated to reach consensus. Cohen’s kappa for the initial two raters was 0.67, indicating substantial agreement. A double-blind procedure ensured raters were unaware of writing mode (DeepSeek-assisted versus traditional) and timing (phase). TEM-4 scores were checked for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test (W=0.952, p=0.132).",
		"data_analysis_method (数据分析方法)": "Quantitative analysis used SPSS 27 to conduct independent t-tests comparing scores in the baseline phase with those in the intervention phase and with those in the follow-up phase for each writing dimension and the total score; repeated-measures MANOVA examined the effects of baseline writing proficiency and AI intervention on the combined five dimensions; partial eta squared values were reported as effect sizes.

	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "Six-week study comprising a one-week baseline period (two unassisted writings), a four-week intervention period (alternating DeepSeek-assisted and traditional writing weeks), and a follow-up period at the end of the six weeks (two unassisted writings).",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "DeepSeek (generative AI chatbot, large language model)",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "DeepSeek is described as a powerful AI agent for natural language interaction and its proliferation as DeepSeek R1 by the end of 2023 is noted, but the specific model version, interface (web UI, API, or platform integration), and parameter settings used in the study were not reported.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students directly used DeepSeek as an AI writing assistant during designated AI-assisted writing sessions in the intervention phase; the tool provided revision support and feedback on their writing, with no indication that the teacher mediated or post-processed DeepSeek’s output before students saw it.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "During AI-assisted weeks, students wrote and then received assistance from DeepSeek, which offered multiple suggestions and corrections related to vocabulary, grammar, mechanics, and sometimes structure and content; the article does not describe a formal prompting strategy, scripted prompts, few-shot examples, or explicit prompt engineering techniques, and interview data suggest that DeepSeek often provided abundant and detailed feedback that students had to interpret on their own.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Participants were uninformed of the impending study and remained oblivious to DeepSeek’s role in revision support during the initial baseline writing phase; the article does not report explicit training in how to use DeepSeek, how to formulate prompts, or how to critically evaluate AI suggestions. Several interviewed students expressed a need for guidance and collaboration when working with DeepSeek, implying that LLM literacy support was limited.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "The experiment comprised three phases. Baseline period (one week): students wrote two in-class compositions, each within 30 minutes, entirely by themselves without using any AI tools or other writing assistants, to establish individual writing proficiency baselines. Intervention period (four weeks): odd-numbered weeks were designated for DeepSeek-assisted writing, where students produced compositions with DeepSeek as an AI assistant; even-numbered weeks were used for traditional writing without AI assistance. Writing tasks in odd and even weeks were semantically related but did not overlap in content. Follow-up period: two additional unassisted writing samples were collected to assess changes and retention in writing performance. A double-blind scoring procedure was implemented so that evaluators were unaware of the writing mode or timing of the essays. Quantitative analyses compared scores across phases and conditions, and a semi-structured interview was conducted at the end of the follow-up phase to gather student perceptions.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "DeepSeek-assisted writing condition during the intervention phase: in odd-numbered weeks, students engaged in in-class writing tasks with DeepSeek assistance, receiving AI-generated feedback and corrections on vocabulary, grammar, mechanics, and sometimes structural and logical aspects, which they could use to revise and improve their writing.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "NA (single-group repeated-measures design; traditional unassisted writing at baseline, during even-numbered weeks of the intervention period, and in the follow-up phase served as comparison conditions but there was no separate control group).",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Drafting and revision during in-class writing, with DeepSeek providing real-time or iterative feedback and corrections, especially at the revision stage for micro-level linguistic features and, for some learners, macro-level reasoning and structure.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "General English compositions produced in an advanced English course; specific genres (for example argumentative or narrative essays) were not explicitly specified.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Timed in-class English writing tasks (30-minute compositions) on various topics; two baseline writings, multiple intervention-phase writings in alternating DeepSeek-assisted and traditional conditions on semantically related topics, and two follow-up writings.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "DeepSeek acted as an AI writing assistant that generated feedback and suggestions rather than scores: it provided micro-level corrections and enhancements in vocabulary, grammar, and mechanics, identified subtle errors, suggested more sophisticated lexical choices, contributed to structural coherence, and for higher-proficiency learners offered in-depth logical reasoning scaffolds for content development; it was not used as an automated scoring tool.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "The instructor taught the advanced English course, implemented the three-phase design with alternating DeepSeek-assisted and traditional writing weeks, assigned and collected writing tasks, and arranged for a semi-structured interview at the end of the follow-up period; writing evaluation was carried out by two experienced teachers (and a third mediator when needed) in a double-blind fashion, and the instructor did not directly intervene in DeepSeek’s feedback content.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Face-to-face advanced English course for third-year English majors at a university in north China (Bohai University), with four class periods per week in a traditional classroom setting.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "The study notes that participants were uninformed of the impending study and remained unaware of DeepSeek’s role in revision support during their initial writing phase, but it does not report formal ethical approval procedures or consent processes beyond this statement.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "During the baseline and follow-up phases students were required to write all compositions on their own in class without resorting to any AI tools or other writing assistants. During the intervention phase, odd-numbered weeks allowed DeepSeek-assisted writing while even-numbered weeks required traditional writing without AI assistance. The article does not describe whether students could access DeepSeek outside the study sessions.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "No specific technical safety guardrails, content filters, or institutional AI-use policies related to DeepSeek are reported aside from restrictions on when AI could be used in the study.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "DeepSeek-assisted writing significantly improved EFL learners’ overall writing performance and particularly enhanced micro-level skills such as vocabulary, grammatical accuracy, and mechanics. From baseline to the intervention phase, significant gains were observed in all five rubric dimensions and in total scores. From baseline to the follow-up phase, significant improvements persisted in content, vocabulary, accuracy, mechanics, and overall scores, but not in organization, indicating that organizational gains were less stable over time. MANOVA results showed that baseline writing proficiency accounted for 87.5 percent of variance in the five writing dimensions and the AI intervention accounted for 67.5 percent, demonstrating a large independent contribution of DeepSeek-assisted instruction. Interview findings revealed that all interviewed students perceived improvements from DeepSeek, especially in grammar, vocabulary, and structural coherence; two-thirds highlighted lexical enhancement as particularly influential, and advanced learners noted content improvements. Advanced learners valued DeepSeek’s comprehensive feedback and logical reasoning scaffolds, while lower-proficiency learners focused on error reduction, reported over-reliance on technical corrections, and experienced cognitive overload when confronted with abundant and complex suggestions, especially for organization. These findings underscore the effectiveness of DeepSeek-assisted writing, particularly for micro-level skills, and highlight the need for proficiency-tailored AI support and teacher guidance."

	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Using a five-dimension analytic rubric and weighted total scores, the study found that DeepSeek-assisted writing instruction significantly improved learners’ overall writing performance compared with baseline unassisted writing, with notable gains in vocabulary, grammatical accuracy, and mechanics, and meaningful but less durable gains in organization; short-term follow-up indicated that many of these gains, especially in micro-level skills, were retained, while organizational improvement was not statistically sustained.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "Analytic writing rating rubric inspired by Li et al. with five dimensions: content, organization, vocabulary, grammatical accuracy, and mechanics; each dimension categorized into four levels with a maximum score of 10; overall writing performance calculated as a weighted sum (content 30 percent, organization 20 percent, vocabulary 20 percent, accuracy 20 percent, mechanics 10 percent).",
		"writing_performance_focus (写作表现关注维度_流利度_准确性_复杂度_体裁等)": "Macro-level performance in content and organization (relevance, appropriateness of argument, coherence, logical clarity) and micro-level performance in vocabulary, grammatical accuracy, and mechanics (spelling, punctuation, capitalization) in EFL writing.",
		"affective_aspect_measure (情感因素测量工具_问卷_量表等)": "Semi-structured interviews with six students (three from the high-proficiency group and three from the low-proficiency group) at the end of the follow-up phase.",
		"affective_aspect_focus (情感因素维度_动机_态度_焦虑_自效感等)": "Perceived enhancement of confidence and engagement in EFL writing; generally positive attitudes toward DeepSeek’s immediate and personalized feedback compared to delayed teacher evaluation; advanced learners’ appreciation of DeepSeek’s comprehensive and meticulous feedback; lower-proficiency learners’ mixed attitudes characterized by both appreciation of error reduction and frustration or anxiety related to cognitive overload and difficulty processing complex suggestions; expressed need for guidance and collaboration when using DeepSeek.",
		"cognitive_aspect_measure (认知因素测量工具)": "Thematic analysis of semi-structured interview responses regarding how students understood and used DeepSeek feedback, including logical reasoning scaffolds and suggestions about structure and content; indirect inference from performance patterns in different writing dimensions across phases.",
		"cognitive_aspect_focus (认知因素维度_策略使用_元认知监控等)": "Proficiency-dependent cognitive engagement with AI feedback: higher-proficiency learners reported using DeepSeek’s in-depth logical reasoning scaffolds to refine content and argumentation, while lower-proficiency learners focused mainly on micro-level corrections and found it difficult to digest and integrate abundant or complex feedback, particularly on organization and macro-level structure, indicating limited capacity to process AI suggestions and potential challenges in metacognitive monitoring of revisions.",
		"behavioral_aspect_measure (行为因素测量工具_日志_平台日志等)": "Changes in writing performance across baseline, intervention, and follow-up phases served as behavioral indicators of how learners engaged with DeepSeek-assisted versus traditional writing; interviews elicited self-reported behaviors and usage patterns; no automated usage logs or interaction counts with DeepSeek were collected.",
		"behavioral_aspect_focus (行为因素维度_使用频率_交互模式_坚持度等)": "Regular participation in alternating DeepSeek-assisted and traditional in-class writing tasks; repeated reliance on DeepSeek for grammatical and lexical corrections, particularly among lower-proficiency learners; more selective and strategic use of DeepSeek by advanced learners to enhance arguments and coherence; evidence of over-reliance on AI for technical corrections by some lower-proficiency learners and of difficulty consistently applying structural feedback; exact frequency and duration of AI interactions were not quantified.",
		"other_outcomes_measure (其他结果测量工具)": "NR",
		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "NR",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Baseline phase (two in-class unassisted writings during the first week), intervention phase (four weeks with alternating DeepSeek-assisted and traditional writing tasks on semantically related topics), and follow-up phase at the end of the six-week study (two additional in-class unassisted writing samples).",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Dimension scores for content, organization, vocabulary, grammatical accuracy, and mechanics, and the weighted total writing score, across baseline, intervention, and follow-up phases.",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Writing instruction mode (DeepSeek-assisted versus traditional unassisted writing) and baseline writing proficiency (baseline scores and TEM-4 scores) as key predictors; experimental phase (baseline, intervention, follow-up) as a repeated-measures factor; learner perceptions from interviews as qualitative outcomes.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "Short-term follow-up within the same six-week study: after the four-week intervention phase, a follow-up phase in approximately the sixth week collected two additional unassisted compositions to assess retention of DeepSeek-related gains.",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "From baseline to intervention, independent t-tests showed significant improvements (p<.05) in content, organization, vocabulary, accuracy, mechanics, and total writing score. From baseline to follow-up, significant differences were found in content, vocabulary, accuracy, mechanics, and total score, but not in organization, whose p-value was reported as 0.882, indicating no significant long-term change for this dimension. MANOVA revealed highly significant multivariate effects of baseline writing proficiency (Pillai’s Trace=0.875, F=77.038, df=5,55, p<.001) and AI intervention (Pillai’s Trace=0.675, F=22.872, df=5,55, p<.001) on the combined five writing dimensions.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Baseline writing proficiency had a large multivariate effect on the five writing dimensions, with partial eta squared=0.875, meaning it accounted for 87.5 percent of the variance; the AI intervention also had a large effect, with partial eta squared=0.675, accounting for 67.5 percent of the variance in writing performance. For baseline versus follow-up comparisons on individual dimensions, partial eta squared values were reported as approximately 0.124 for content, 0.185 for vocabulary, 0.164 for accuracy, and 0.122 for mechanics, indicating small-to-moderate effect sizes for sustained improvements; organization had a partial eta squared close to 0 with a non-significant p-value, consistent with the absence of a lasting organizational effect.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "Although no explicit academic misconduct such as plagiarism was reported, the study identified several negative or problematic patterns related to DeepSeek use: lower-proficiency learners showed over-reliance on DeepSeek’s technical corrections, focusing heavily on error reduction in grammar and vocabulary instead of deeper content development; some learners experienced cognitive overload due to the excessive abundance and complexity of DeepSeek’s suggestions, especially for organization and structure, and struggled to process and apply them effectively; vocabulary gains showed a minor decline at follow-up, suggesting that lexical improvements may be less stable without continued practice.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "Proficiency-based subgroup analyses and interviews indicated that higher-proficiency learners achieved greater gains in macro-level performance and content, and valued DeepSeek’s in-depth logical reasoning scaffolds, while lower-proficiency learners primarily benefited from micro-level error reduction, rarely reported improvements in organization, and were more likely to feel confused or overwhelmed by complex feedback. These findings highlight that the impact of DeepSeek-assisted writing is not uniform across proficiency levels and raise equity considerations regarding how AI support should be adapted for learners with different baseline abilities.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "The study involved a relatively small sample of 31 English majors from a single university in north China and employed a single-group repeated-measures design without a separate control group, limiting generalizability and making it difficult to disentangle AI effects from other instructional or temporal influences. The intervention lasted only six weeks, with short-term follow-up but no long-term tracking of writing development. DeepSeek interaction details such as prompts and usage patterns were not logged, constraining analysis of process-level behaviors. Only six students (three high-proficiency and three low-proficiency) participated in interviews, providing limited qualitative coverage. The authors call for longitudinal studies and research in more diverse contexts, implicitly acknowledging the temporal and contextual limitations of the current work.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Challenges reported include learners’ cognitive overload when confronted with numerous and complex DeepSeek suggestions, particularly for organization and structure; difficulty among lower-proficiency learners in understanding and integrating macro-level feedback into their writing; over-reliance on DeepSeek for micro-level technical corrections at the expense of independent problem-solving and deeper content development; and students’ expressed need for teacher guidance and peer collaboration to effectively interpret and apply DeepSeek’s feedback, suggesting that unguided AI use can be problematic for some learners.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "The authors suggest future research should adopt longitudinal designs to examine the long-term effects of AI-assisted writing interventions on learners’ writing competence, explore how baseline proficiency interacts with intervention intensity and type, and investigate the sustainability of AI-driven gains across diverse educational contexts; further work is also needed to understand the interaction mechanisms between baseline proficiency and DeepSeek intervention and to develop differentiated AI-supported instructional strategies tailored to various learner profiles.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study implies that DeepSeek and similar generative AI chatbots can effectively enhance EFL learners’ micro-level writing skills, but that macro-level skills such as organization and higher-order content development require more than generic AI feedback and are strongly mediated by learners’ initial proficiency. Pedagogically, the findings highlight the necessity of proficiency-tailored AI assistance, where advanced learners can leverage AI for logical reasoning and content scaffolding, while lower-proficiency learners need carefully structured support to avoid over-reliance and cognitive overload. The results underscore the importance of integrating AI tools with teacher guidance and peer collaboration rather than using AI in isolation and suggest that EFL writing pedagogy should deliberately combine AI-mediated error correction with instructional strategies that foster deeper understanding of text structure and argument logic."
