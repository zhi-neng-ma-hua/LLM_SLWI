		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Before treatment, individual accounts were created for experimental group B to use EditGPT and students were informed how to upload or paste their texts; all groups received explanations on narrative and compare-and-contrast essay formats and examples, but there was no detailed training on AI literacy, prompt design, or critical evaluation of EditGPT feedback reported.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "Data collection lasted four weeks. Week 1: a writing pretest on course-related topics was administered to all three groups to ensure similar writing proficiency; accounts for EditGPT were set up for experimental group B; all groups received explanations about narrative essay structure and examples based on the course book. Week 2: all students wrote an essay on a unit topic using narrative writing strategies and submitted it within three days. Control group received general feedback from researchers with errors underlined using abbreviations and no detailed explanations; experimental group A received detailed one-to-one, face-to-face feedback on each utterance and sentence (task achievement, organization, lexicon, grammar, punctuation, spelling, mechanics); experimental group B was instructed to use EditGPT to obtain automated feedback and did not receive researcher feedback. Week 3: the same procedure was repeated for a compare-and-contrast essay based on course content; experimental group B again used EditGPT as the sole feedback source. Week 4: all groups took a posttest writing task on comparison-and-contrast topics; pretest, in-class writing assignments, and posttest topics were the same across groups, and students could not freely choose topics.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Experimental group A (n=20) received detailed individual face-to-face feedback from the researchers for each of the two treatment essays, addressing task achievement, organization, lexical choice, grammar, punctuation, spelling, and mechanics. Experimental group B (n=20) used EditGPT exclusively to obtain automated written corrective feedback on the same assignments by copying/pasting or uploading their work to the tool; they did not receive researcher feedback on these tasks.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "The control group (n=20) received only general feedback from the researchers: their mistakes were underlined using abbreviations to indicate problem areas without further explanation; no detailed sentence-level feedback or AI-based feedback was provided.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "EditGPT was used at the revision and editing stage after students had drafted their essays; students in experimental group B submitted their drafts to EditGPT, received automated corrective feedback, and could revise accordingly before the posttest.",

		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Short academic essays (approximately 150 words) with specified structure (introduction, two supporting paragraphs, concluding paragraph) drawn from the pre-intermediate coursebook English in the 21st Century, used as pretest, in-class/take-home assignments, and posttest tasks.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "EditGPT acted as an AI-assisted automated writing evaluator and editor, providing automated written corrective feedback by identifying and correcting spelling and grammatical errors, suggesting alternative vocabulary and phrasing, highlighting inconsistencies and repetition, and offering suggestions to improve coherence and organization; it did not generate full essays but supported revision of student-produced texts.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "Researchers and teachers provided conventional writing instruction on narrative and compare-and-contrast essays to all groups, administered pretests and posttests, and delivered feedback according to group condition: general underlining feedback for the control group, detailed individualized face-to-face feedback for experimental group A, and no feedback for experimental group B beyond access to EditGPT; they also set up EditGPT accounts for experimental group B and evaluated all pretest and posttest essays using the researcher-made rubric.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Higher education institution in Oman, General Foundation Program pre-intermediate English course; traditional in-person teaching with writing tasks completed partly as homework and feedback through face-to-face sessions or via online interaction with EditGPT.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Institutional permission was obtained to involve Foundation Program students in extracurricular research activities; prior to data collection, participants were given instructions about the study and informed that their data would be kept confidential, and they provided explicit consent to participate.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Experimental group B students were given individual EditGPT accounts and instructed to use the tool to paste or upload their essays for feedback; they were told they would not receive feedback from the researchers on these tasks, positioning EditGPT as their primary feedback source; control and experimental group A did not use EditGPT for feedback during the study.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "EditGPT is described as being built using Constitutional AI so that the model functions safely and in users’ best interests; no additional study-specific safety filters, monitoring, or academic integrity checks related to EditGPT use are reported.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "All three groups improved from pretest to posttest in writing performance, but posttest ANOVA showed significant differences among groups: experimental group A (detailed human feedback) achieved the highest mean posttest score, experimental group B (EditGPT-only feedback) outperformed the control group, and the control group showed the smallest gains. These results indicate that EditGPT as an AI-assisted automated corrective feedback tool can enhance EFL writing performance more than general minimal teacher feedback, though detailed human feedback led to the largest improvements. Perception data from experimental group B showed that most students felt they could revise their writing based on EditGPT feedback, believed EditGPT improved their writing quality and grammar, and reported that it helped them understand writing issues; at the same time, students were less convinced about the comprehensibility of all feedback messages and did not believe EditGPT helped them increase their vocabulary size."

	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Effectiveness was evaluated using pretest–posttest writing scores assessed with a researcher-made rubric and analyzed via ANOVA, and through a Likert-scale perception questionnaire administered to the EditGPT group. Statistically, both experimental groups (teacher feedback and EditGPT feedback) outperformed the control group at posttest, with the teacher-feedback group performing best and the EditGPT group showing intermediate gains, supporting the usability of EditGPT as a complementary tool. Perception data indicated generally positive views of EditGPT’s usefulness for revision and writing improvement, with some reservations about vocabulary support and clarity of all feedback.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "Researcher-made writing assessment rubric (task achievement, organization and coherence, range and accuracy of grammatical structures, range and accuracy of vocabulary) with reported reliability of 0.71, used to score pretest and posttest narrative and compare-and-contrast essays.",
		"writing_performance_focus (写作表现关注维度_流利度_准确性_复杂度_体裁等)": "Global writing performance with emphasis on task achievement, organization and coherence, grammatical accuracy, and vocabulary range and accuracy in narrative and compare-and-contrast essay genres; a grammar-focused analysis of pretest and posttest was also undertaken in recognition that automated tools often change grammar and sentence structures.",
		"affective_aspect_measure (情感因素测量工具_问卷_量表等)": "Adapted and translated 10-item 5-point Likert-scale questionnaire from Huang and Renandya (2020) administered to experimental group B, with three subscales on perceived comprehensibility of EditGPT feedback, perceived advantages of feedback for revision, and perceived usefulness of feedback for improving writing performance; Arabic version showed Cronbach’s alpha values of 0.80, 0.81, and 0.83 for the three sections.",
		"affective_aspect_focus (情感因素维度_动机_态度_焦虑_自效感等)": "Students’ perceptions of EditGPT feedback in terms of clarity and comprehensibility, usefulness for correcting grammatical mistakes, helping them get higher marks and increase writing quality, helping them understand their writing issues, improving grammar, contributing to vocabulary, and overall impact on writing performance.",

		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Feedback condition with three levels (control group with general minimal teacher feedback, experimental group A with detailed individual teacher feedback, experimental group B with EditGPT automated feedback only); time (pretest vs posttest) as within-subject factor when considering gains qualitatively; for the perception study, the primary factor is exposure to EditGPT feedback within experimental group B.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Shapiro–Wilk tests indicated normally distributed writing scores for all groups at both pretest and posttest (all p>0.05). One-way ANOVA on pretest scores showed no significant difference among groups (F=0.914, p=0.413), confirming similar baseline writing performance. One-way ANOVA on posttest scores showed a significant difference among the three groups (F=84.940, p=0.000), indicating that feedback type had a significant effect on posttest writing performance, with experimental group A scoring highest, experimental group B intermediate, and the control group lowest. Statistical tests for perception questionnaire items were not reported beyond descriptive statistics.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Effect sizes (such as eta-squared, partial eta-squared, or Cohen’s d) were not reported for either the pretest or posttest ANOVAs or for the perception questionnaire.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The study does not report instances of EditGPT misuse, but it notes limitations of AI-only feedback: EditGPT was not able to tailor feedback to the learners’ cognitive level of understanding, making it harder to individualize support; face-to-face clarification and emotional intelligence present in teacher feedback were missing when students only used EditGPT; some students indicated that the comprehensibility of EditGPT feedback was limited and required further explanation; and students perceived that EditGPT did not help them increase their vocabulary size.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "NR",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Reported limitations include a relatively small sample size of sixty students from a single Omani higher education institution; focus on only pre-intermediate proficiency students in one General Foundation Program; potential influence of extraneous factors such as tiredness, hunger, or lack of motivation because participation occurred beyond regular classes; focus on one AI tool (EditGPT) while other tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, and PaperPal were not examined; and restriction to writing performance, with no investigation of AI support for other language skills such as reading, listening, or speaking.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Practical challenges highlighted include limited teaching time and crowded classes that make it difficult for teachers to provide detailed individualized feedback, the need to integrate AI tools such as EditGPT without diminishing the central pedagogical role of the teacher, the difficulty of ensuring that AI feedback is fully comprehensible to learners without supplementary explanations, and the logistical burden of running additional writing tasks as extracurricular activities for busy Foundation students.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "The authors suggest future research with larger samples; inclusion of learners at different proficiency levels and from multiple institutions in Oman; implementation of studies in contexts where students can focus more fully on the treatment without competing demands; comparative studies of various AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly, PaperPal) on writing performance; and investigations of AI tools for feedback on other skills such as reading, listening, and speaking.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study implies that AI-assisted automated corrective feedback tools like EditGPT can serve as useful complements to teacher feedback in EFL writing classes, helping students become more independent and providing syntactic and semantic corrections that reduce repeated errors, while also alleviating some of the feedback burden on teachers in large or time-constrained classes. However, teacher feedback remains crucial for deeper, individualized, and emotionally attuned guidance, and AI tools should be integrated to support a learner-centred, blended feedback model where institutions facilitate access to such tools without replacing the teacher’s central role."
