Writing: 45-minute argumentative essays on topics derived from Han (2024) for the pre- and immediate post-tests and a similar self-constructed globalization topic for the follow-up, scored using the academic discussion rubric from the TOEFL iBT writing section. Qualitative perceptions: free-response form with three open-ended questions adapted from Karataş et al. (2024) asking about strengths, challenges, and recommendations regarding chatbot use.",
		"data_collection_validity_reliability (工具信度与效度)": "Writing assessments employed the standardized TOEFL iBT academic discussion rubric to ensure reliability and validity. Two English teachers (PhD holders with over 10 years of teaching experience), affiliated with universities outside the study site and unaware of group assignment, independently scored all listening and writing assessments; inter-rater reliability was ensured via simple percentage agreement above 80%, and discrepant scores were averaged. A pilot study with eight non-English-major students was conducted to test the feasibility of the intervention, assessment, coding, and scoring procedures.",
		"data_analysis_method (数据分析方法)": "Quantitative listening and writing scores were analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA using R software, followed by Holm-adjusted paired t-tests for within-group comparisons and unpaired t-tests for between-group comparisons; significance level was set at α<0.05. Assumptions of normality, sphericity, and homogeneity of variances were verified using Q-Q plots, Mauchly’s test, and Levene’s test, respectively, and were not violated.

Additional details of rater training are not reported."
	},
	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "Ten consecutive weekly GenAI-mediated learning activities during a 10-week period starting in early March 2024, with assessments at pre-test (late February 2024), immediate post-test (mid-May 2024), and delayed follow-up (early September 2024 after a summer break).",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "Gemini (Google GenAI chatbot) for listening activities; ChatGPT (OpenAI) for writing activities.",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "Gemini was accessed via a web interface where students triggered audio playback of generated texts using a Listen button, followed by built-in comprehension tasks. ChatGPT was accessed via a private Telegram chatbot configured via BotFather using an OpenAI API key and a hidden system prompt instructing the AI to act as an academic writing instructor, automatically scoring assignments on a 0–5 scale aligned with TOEFL iBT descriptors and generating recommendations.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students in the experimental group interacted directly with Gemini using researcher-designed prompts for listening practice and directly with a ChatGPT-powered Telegram chatbot for submitting their weekly writing assignments and receiving scores and feedback; both LLMs were used as external tools alongside the regular EFL course rather than fully embedded in an LMS.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "Weekly listening comprehension prompts designed by the researcher (Appendix I) were used to trigger Gemini to produce level-appropriate stories or conversations and subsequent cloze tasks; the ChatGPT Telegram bot employed a hidden system prompt that framed the model as an academic writing instructor, guiding it to evaluate coherence, structure, grammar, and clarity and to assign scores from 0 to 5 in line with TOEFL iBT writing descriptors; students chose from a researcher-provided list of topics when composing weekly essays.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Both groups had self-reported moderate prior experience with GenAI and were given a link to an online course on using GenAI for academic purposes that covered functionalities (including prompting skills), limitations, and ethical considerations, providing baseline GenAI literacy; no additional structured in-class training on prompt design or critical evaluation of AI output is reported.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "Following pre-testing, participants were randomly allocated to an experimental group or a comparison group. Over ten weeks, the experimental group, in addition to standard EFL classroom instruction, completed weekly GenAI-mediated activities. For listening, students used researcher-designed prompts with Gemini to generate level-appropriate stories or conversations, listened to the audio without reading the on-screen text, completed cloze tasks with ten unpredictable gaps, received immediate automated feedback on their responses, and could access further text with associated exercises. For writing, each week they selected a topic from a researcher-provided list, wrote at least 300 words, and submitted this text to a ChatGPT-powered Telegram chatbot, which scored the assignment from 0 to 5 based on TOEFL iBT-like criteria and provided targeted feedback on coherence, structure, grammar, clarity, and recurrent writing patterns. Weekly participation in these chatbot activities was mandatory for the experimental group and was verified through screenshots submitted to an anonymous research assistant. The comparison group followed the same weekly instructional schedule in class (worksheet-based activities, audiotape listening exercises, and writing assignments) but did not use the researcher-designed GenAI tools; they were simply offered the option to use chatbots of their choice to support language skills, without structured prompts or monitoring. All students completed an immediate post-test and a delayed follow-up assessment on listening and writing.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Experimental group students (n=48) received the regular mandatory EFL curriculum plus ten weekly GenAI-mediated listening and writing activities: Gemini-generated listening texts with cloze comprehension tasks and immediate feedback, and ChatGPT-based weekly writing practice via Telegram where they submitted at least 300-word academic texts on specified topics, received automated 0–5 scores aligned with TOEFL iBT and detailed feedback on coherence, structure, grammar, clarity, and topic focus, with weekly engagement required and documented by screenshots.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Comparison group students (n=45) followed the same in-class traditional EFL curriculum (worksheet-based activities, audiotape listening, and writing assignments) but did not have access to the researcher-designed Gemini prompts or the bespoke ChatGPT Telegram writing bot; they were allowed to use chatbots of their choice on their own initiative to enhance their language skills, but such use was optional, unstructured, and not monitored.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Weekly GenAI-mediated writing activities targeted the drafting and feedback stages of academic writing, where students composed texts independently and then received automated scoring and feedback from ChatGPT; writing performance was evaluated in separate timed assessments at pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed follow-up where no chatbot assistance was provided.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Argumentative academic discussion essays on debatable issues requiring reasoned arguments and specific examples.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Timed 45-minute argumentative essays for assessment purposes and weekly 300-word academic writing assignments on researcher-suggested topics for chatbot-mediated practice and feedback.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "Gemini generated level-appropriate listening texts, delivered audio output, presented cloze comprehension tasks, checked responses, and supplied further text and exercises. The ChatGPT-powered Telegram chatbot functioned as an academic writing tutor that received students’ weekly essays, provided immediate and targeted feedback on coherence, structure, grammar, clarity, transitions, topic focus, and vocabulary, and assigned holistic scores from 0 to 5 in accordance with TOEFL iBT-like criteria.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "EFL instructors delivered the standard curriculum and classroom activities for both groups. The researcher designed the GenAI-mediated activities, including listening prompts and the ChatGPT Telegram bot configuration, required weekly participation from the experimental group, and organized verification of chatbot engagement via an anonymous research assistant. Teachers did not intervene in each chatbot interaction but remained responsible for overall course design, instruction, and assessment administration.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Mandatory EFL courses for non-English-major undergraduates at a public university in Kazakhstan; classroom instruction appears to be face-to-face, while GenAI-mediated activities were completed flexibly by students at their convenience outside regular class hours.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Ethics committee approval was obtained from the first author’s institution. All participants received detailed information about study procedures, their rights (including the right to withdraw without penalty), and data confidentiality, and they provided informed consent prior to participation. A pilot study led to improved instructions for removing personally identifying details from screenshots before emailing them to protect privacy.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Experimental group students were required to engage weekly with the specific Gemini and ChatGPT tasks, with engagement verified through screenshot submissions to an anonymous research assistant. Comparison group students were permitted, but not required, to use chatbots of their choice to support language learning, without access to the tailored GenAI tools used in the experimental group. Both groups were provided with an online course link explaining GenAI functionalities, limitations, and ethical considerations, but no further detailed institutional AI-use policy is reported.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "Safety and ethics were addressed largely through the online GenAI course covering limitations and ethical considerations and through privacy safeguards requiring students to remove personally identifying details from screenshots; no specific technical content filters, automated misuse detection, or explicit guardrails embedded in the LLM systems are described.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Quantitatively, both groups improved over time in listening and writing, but the experimental group that engaged in ten weeks of Gemini- and ChatGPT-mediated activities showed significantly larger gains at the immediate post-test. For writing, there was a significant main effect of time and a significant group×time interaction but no overall main effect of group; at pre-test, groups did not differ (experimental M=2.90, SD=0.69; control M=3.02, SD=0.66), whereas at post-test the experimental group attained higher scores (M=3.63, SD=0.73) than the control group (M=3.18, SD=0.65, t(91)=-3.12, p=0.017). At follow-up, writing scores declined slightly for both groups (experimental M=3.21, SD=0.62; control M=3.09, SD=0.70), and the between-group difference was no longer significant. Within the experimental group, writing scores significantly increased from pre-test to post-test (t(47)=-7.85, p=0.001), and gains were marginally sustained at follow-up relative to baseline (t(47)=-2.70, p=0.058) but dropped significantly from post-test to follow-up (t(47)=4.71, p=0.001). The control group exhibited no significant changes in writing scores across time. Qualitative analysis showed that students appreciated the personalized and engaging language exposure and the immediate, constructive feedback provided by the chatbots, particularly the writing bot’s ability to identify recurring patterns (e.g., overuse of particular connectors, insufficient topic focus, repeated vocabulary) and to suggest improvements; however, they also reported challenges such as inconsistent quality of Gemini-generated listening content, occasional simplicity or childishness of stories, repetitive listening tasks when performance thresholds were not met, and a need for clearer task structures and more focused, digestible writing feedback."

	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Effectiveness of GenAI-mediated activities was evaluated with repeated quantitative assessments of listening cloze scores and TOEFL iBT rubric-based writing scores at pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed follow-up, combined with qualitative thematic analysis of students’ reflections. Results indicated that chatbot-assisted EFL learning produced significantly greater short-term improvements in both listening and writing performance for the experimental group compared to a traditional curriculum with optional unstructured chatbot use, although these advantages diminished by the delayed follow-up, suggesting strong short-term but less sustained effects.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "45-minute argumentative essays on topics derived from Han (2024) at pre-test and immediate post-test and a similar researcher-constructed globalization topic at follow-up, all scored using the academic discussion rubric from the TOEFL iBT writing section by two independent PhD-level raters.",
		"writing_performance_focus (写作表现关注维度_流利度_准确性_复杂度_体裁等)": "Overall academic discussion writing proficiency as captured by the TOEFL iBT rubric, including task relevance, organization, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy, clarity of expression, and development of arguments and specific examples.",
		"affective_aspect_measure (情感因素测量工具_问卷_量表等)": "Free-response form with three open-ended questions adapted from Karataş et al. (2024) administered at the immediate post-test to the experimental group.",
		"affective_aspect_focus (情感因素维度_动机_态度_焦虑_自效感等)": "Learners’ attitudes toward and perceptions of chatbot use, including perceived strengths (personalized and engaging input, immediate and constructive feedback, increased awareness of writing conventions), perceived challenges (inconsistent content quality, repetitive tasks, cognitive load of dense feedback), and recommendations for improving usability and task design.",

		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Instructional condition (experimental group with weekly Gemini- and ChatGPT-mediated activities versus comparison group with traditional curriculum and optional unstructured chatbot use); time (pre-test, immediate post-test, delayed follow-up); and the interaction between condition and time.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "Delayed follow-up test administered approximately three to four months after the immediate post-test, at the start of the new semester following a summer break.",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Listening: repeated-measures ANOVA showed significant main effects of time (F(2,182)=93.14, p=0.001) and group (F(1,91)=5.58, p=0.02) and a significant group×time interaction (F(2,182)=9.39, p=0.001). At pre-test, no significant group difference was found (experimental M=4.44, SD=1.25; control M=4.20, SD=1.10; t(91)=-0.97, p=0.415). At post-test, the experimental group (M=6.21, SD=1.68) significantly outperformed the control group (M=5.09, SD=1.35; t(89)=-3.56, p=0.002). At follow-up, the group difference was not significant (experimental M=5.73, SD=1.48; control M=5.31, SD=1.10; t(87)=-1.55, p=0.376). Writing: repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of time (F(2,182)=20.51, p=0.001) and a significant group×time interaction (F(2,182)=8.62, p=0.001), but no significant main effect of group (F(1,91)=1.62, p=0.206). At pre-test, no significant difference existed between groups (control M=3.02, SD=0.66; experimental M=2.90, SD=0.69; t(91)=0.90, p=1.00). By post-test, the experimental group (M=3.63, SD=0.73) scored significantly higher than the control group (M=3.18, SD=0.65; t(91)=-3.12, p=0.017). At follow-up, group differences in writing were not significant (experimental M=3.21, SD=0.62; control M=3.09, SD=0.70; t(88)=-0.87, p=1.00). Within the experimental group, both listening and writing scores increased significantly from pre-test to post-test and remained significantly above baseline at follow-up, although significant declines from post-test to follow-up were observed; the control group showed significant listening gains over time but no significant changes in writing.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "For listening, repeated-measures ANOVA effect sizes were η²=0.168 for time, η²=0.047 for group, and η²=0.020 for the group×time interaction, indicating large time effects and smaller but meaningful group and interaction effects. For writing, effect sizes were η²=0.068 for time and η²=0.030 for the group×time interaction, indicating modest but non-trivial effects of the GenAI-assisted intervention over time; no standardized effect sizes such as Cohen’s d were reported for the t-tests.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "Students reported that Gemini’s generated stories were sometimes simplistic or childish and that the quality and challenge level of content could be inconsistent, potentially reducing engagement; some noted that cloze tasks occasionally removed words that were easy to guess. Repetition of listening tasks on the same topic when performance thresholds were not met was perceived as monotonous. In the discussion, the author also references concerns from the broader literature about potential over-reliance on ChatGPT and the need for additional scaffolding and varied practice to sustain gains, but no explicit instances of plagiarism or severe misuse tied to the study’s GenAI tools were reported.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "No subgroup analyses by gender, department, proficiency level, or other demographic variables were reported, and equity or differential impact across learner subgroups was not explicitly discussed.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Limitations noted include the relatively short 10-week intervention followed by a summer break that may have affected retention, the use of screenshot submission to verify chatbot engagement which may have disrupted natural learning flow, the lack of isolation of the effect of personalized interest-based listening content from the chatbot modality itself, the absence of systematic monitoring of participants’ additional chatbot use outside required tasks, and the preliminary nature of the study which did not incorporate more detailed monitoring or controls such as comprehensive usage logs or factorial manipulations of personalization.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges and risks included minor inconveniences and technical issues in verifying engagement via emailed screenshots and ensuring privacy (requiring refinement of instructions to remove personally identifying details), managing inconsistent difficulty and depth of AI-generated listening texts, addressing student perceptions of repetitive listening tasks when they were required to repeat stories on the same topic after inadequate performance, and the difficulty of monitoring and controlling unstructured chatbot use outside the intervention without interfering with authentic learning.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research directions highlighted include investigating strategies to sustain GenAI-induced gains beyond the short term, optimizing AI-generated content for consistent challenge and relevance, refining user experience and task structures for both listening and writing, employing unobtrusive tracking tools or integrated log data to monitor chatbot engagement without interrupting learning, disentangling the effects of personalized interest-driven content from the technology platform itself, and implementing more robust designs with additional controls and monitoring of extracurricular chatbot use to deepen understanding of how personalized AI-based language practice supports long-term L2 development.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study implies that GenAI chatbots, when integrated thoughtfully as learning buddies, can provide personalized, engaging input and immediate, targeted feedback that enhance EFL learners’ listening and writing in the short term. It suggests that learners should adopt purposeful prompting strategies and seek varied chatbot-generated tasks to avoid repetition, while educators should integrate structured reflection on language difficulties and AI feedback, carefully monitor the variety and difficulty of AI-generated tasks, and embed GenAI tools in ways that complement rather than replace human instruction, thereby enriching language education frameworks and supporting more effective L2 learning and teaching."
