	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "5-week curriculum with 10 strategy-based instruction sessions (two per week) covering three phases of process-oriented writing (planning: lessons 1–4; drafting: lessons 5–7; revising: lessons 8–10), with assessments at baseline before instruction, immediately after the 5-week course, and at one-month follow-up.",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "GPT-4 (OpenAI), model GPT-4-0314",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "GPT-4-0314 accessed via OpenAI API through a dedicated web application; the 'system' role was used to define model behavior and dynamically updated to reflect curriculum stages; configuration parameters included temperature=0.5, maximum length=512, top p=0.85, frequency penalty=0.3, and presence penalty=0.2.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "Students in the LLM group interacted directly with GPT-4 through a custom web application on iPads during CALLA-LLM sessions, while teachers managed and updated system prompts to align with the preparation, presentation, practice, evaluation, and expansion phases of CALLA; the control group followed the same curriculum without LLM support.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "A modular hybrid prompt design was used, combining general curriculum prompts at the start of each lesson specifying course objectives, expected outcomes, and student grade level, with phase-specific prompts aligned with the CALLA phases (preparation, presentation, practice, evaluation, expansion); teachers could input or toggle custom prompts per phase, and students were allowed to freely interact with the LLM during selected segments by posing questions, seeking clarifications, or requesting additional examples.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Two experienced English teachers underwent a 4-week training program with bi-weekly 1-hour seminars on SRL strategies, integrating strategy-based instruction with process writing, and applying the CALLA or CALLA-LLM models; students and their parents/guardians were informed of GPT-4’s involvement and the instructional design, and control group students received three condensed CALLA-LLM sessions after the study to introduce the model and GPT-4 functionalities; explicit, systematic training for students on LLM literacy (e.g., critical evaluation of AI output, prompt design, or academic integrity related to LLM use) was not reported.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "Both groups followed a 10-lesson process-oriented writing curriculum over 5 weeks, structured into planning (lessons 1–4: goal-setting, brainstorming, organizing ideas, considering audience needs), drafting (lessons 5–7: content generation, vocabulary enhancement, syntactic variety, cohesion for flow and coherence), and revising (lessons 8–10: evaluating drafts, incorporating feedback, improving structure, and integrating strategies across phases). In the LLM group, CALLA-LLM integrated GPT-4 support throughout the CALLA phases: preparation (LLM provided supplementary materials and sample essays highlighting rhetorical elements), presentation (LLM generated custom examples, demonstrations, and translations, adapting explanations based on learner responses), practice (LLM generated personalized assignments, provided real-time feedback, hints, and allowed resubmissions), evaluation (LLM offered granular analyses of student work such as strategy use and recurrent errors), and expansion (LLM produced personalized transfer tasks and continued real-time adaptive guidance). The control group experienced the same strategy content and process-oriented structure under traditional CALLA, with teachers providing all scaffolding without LLM support.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "CALLA-LLM instruction in which students received process-oriented SRL writing strategy instruction (planning, text generation, revision, self-monitoring) embedded in CALLA phases and supported by GPT-4 via a web application on iPads, including personalized modeling and practice tasks, real-time contextualized feedback, adaptive explanations, and strategy-focused guidance across preparation, presentation, practice, evaluation, and expansion phases.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Traditional CALLA strategy-based instruction using the same 10-lesson process-oriented writing curriculum and SRL writing strategies with teacher-led demonstrations, guided practice, and feedback, but without any LLM integration or GPT-4 support during the intervention period.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Planning (goal-setting, brainstorming, organizing concepts, considering audience), drafting/text generation (content generation, vocabulary and syntactic variety, cohesion), and revising (evaluating drafts, incorporating feedback, structural improvements, and integrating strategies from all phases).",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Short descriptive/experiential essays on familiar topics such as favorite holiday, school, and book, requiring introduction and description of the topic in at least 70 words.",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Timed in-class writing tasks (approximately 30–40 minutes) at baseline, posttest, and follow-up where students wrote short essays of no less than 70 words on assigned topics; additional in-class writing and revision tasks were used during CALLA/CALLA-LLM lessons to practice SRL strategies in process-oriented writing.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "GPT-4 acted as an adaptive conversational tutor and scaffold, providing personalized explanations, sample essays and examples, translations of key ideas into students’ native language when beneficial, real-time contextualized feedback on writing tasks, hints and suggestions to correct misconceptions, generation of personalized practice and transfer tasks, and granular analysis of learners’ work such as strategy use and recurring errors; it did not perform formal grading but supported composition, SRL strategy practice, and reflective evaluation.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "Human teachers remained central to instruction: they activated prior knowledge, introduced and modeled SRL writing strategies and process-oriented writing phases, orchestrated CALLA or CALLA-LLM procedures, selected and sequenced tasks, facilitated and monitored students’ interactions with GPT-4, intervened when GPT-4’s feedback or tasks were unclear or not directly applicable, and provided cognitive and emotional support to maintain engagement and align AI-assisted activities with educational objectives.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "Face-to-face summer camp program organized by a university and implemented in an elementary school in China, with two separate sixth-grade classes (LLM vs control) taught by trained English teachers using the same SRL-based, process-oriented writing curriculum.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Study protocols were developed with engagement and approval from the school principal and grade-level teachers; all participants and their parents/guardians were informed about the research design and GPT-4 involvement and provided written informed consent; the experiment was approved by the Ethical Committee of Wenzhou University (WZU-2023-081) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki; after the study, control group students received three condensed CALLA-LLM sessions to ensure equitable access to potential benefits.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Only students in the LLM group were provided with iPads to access the GPT-4 web application via the dedicated CALLA-LLM platform during class sessions; interactions with GPT-4 occurred within structured CALLA-LLM lessons under teacher supervision; control group students did not use GPT-4 during the experimental period but attended three condensed CALLA-LLM sessions after the study; no additional explicit institutional LLM usage policies or restrictions beyond ethical oversight and parental consent were described.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "A dedicated web application based on open-source code was developed; teachers could update system prompts in real time; all sensitive data and chat logs were stored locally in the browser’s indexedDB, and interactions with GPT-4 occurred only via OpenAI’s API to protect data privacy; no specific content filtering rules, hallucination controls, or automated misuse detection mechanisms for GPT-4 outputs were reported beyond teacher monitoring.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Compared with traditional CALLA instruction, CALLA-LLM significantly enhanced students’ writing performance, SRL writing strategies, and aspects of writing motivation. Linear mixed-effects models showed that from baseline to one-month follow-up, the LLM group’s composition score gains were approximately 5.13 points higher than those of the control group (p=0.021), with substantial overall time effects in both groups but a steeper and more sustained improvement in the LLM group. For SRL writing strategies, group×time interactions from T0 to T2 were significant and positive for planning, text generation, revision, and monitoring strategies, indicating that the LLM group demonstrated larger and more lasting increases in reported strategy use, while the control group’s gains were modest and often regressed toward baseline at follow-up. For writing motivation, the LLM group showed significantly larger increases than the control group in writing self-efficacy and interest immediately after the intervention, and sustained significantly higher gains in writing self-efficacy at one-month follow-up, though the advantage in writing interest diminished over time and did not remain significant at follow-up. Overall, the findings provide empirical support that the CALLA-LLM model can effectively enhance EFL writing strategy instruction and composition performance while illustrating the importance of 'Humans in the Loop'—teachers’ ongoing cognitive and emotional support was necessary to clarify GPT-4 feedback, mitigate confusion, and sustain engagement."

	"Outcome": {
		"application_effectiveness_overview (应用效果总体评价与测量工具)": "Using Hyland’s analytic scoring rubric for writing tasks, the Bai et al. SRL writing strategy questionnaire, and an adapted Pintrich and De Groot motivation scale, the CALLA-LLM model produced significantly greater and more durable improvements than traditional CALLA in composition scores, SRL writing strategy use, and writing self-efficacy, with moderate to large model-explained variance in outcomes and evidence that most gains were maintained one month after instruction.",
		"writing_performance_measure (写作表现测量工具_量表或评分标准)": "Hyland’s (2003) analytic scoring criteria with three components: sentence structures and vocabulary (maximum 40 points), organization and coherence (maximum 20 points), and format and content (maximum 40 points); total possible composition score 100, with scores averaged across two trained raters.",

		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "Baseline independent-samples t-tests showed no significant differences between LLM and control groups on composition scores, SRL strategies, writing self-efficacy, or writing interest (all p between 0.620 and 0.746). Linear mixed-effects models revealed that from T0 to T2, the LLM group’s increase in composition scores was significantly greater than that of the control group (group×time estimate=5.13, p=0.021), while the T0–T1 difference (estimate=4.16) approached but did not reach significance (p=0.061). For SRL strategies, group×time interaction effects from T0 to T2 were significant for planning (estimate=0.37, p=0.019), text generation (estimate=0.39, p=0.007), revision (estimate=0.35, p=0.016), and monitoring (estimate=0.31, p=0.012). For writing motivation, group×time interactions from T0 to T1 were significant for writing self-efficacy (estimate=0.29, p=0.024) and writing interest (estimate=0.27, p=0.039), while from T0 to T2 the interaction remained significant for self-efficacy (estimate=0.25, p=0.044) but not for interest (estimate=0.19, p=0.142). Within-group time effects (repeated-measures F statistics) were significant in the LLM group for composition scores (F=31.9, p<0.001), all four SRL strategies (F=12.73–16.24, all p<0.001), writing self-efficacy (F=24.02, p<0.001), and writing interest (F=14.63, p<0.001); in the control group, time effects were significant for composition scores (F=10.5, p<0.001) and writing self-efficacy (F=7.41, p<0.001), while SRL strategy changes and writing interest changes were not significant at p<0.05.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Linear mixed-effects models reported marginal R² (variance explained by fixed effects) and conditional R² (variance explained by fixed and random effects) for each outcome: for composition scores, R²_marginal≈0.195 and R²_conditional≈0.640; for SRL strategies, R²_marginal ranged from 0.079 to 0.102 and R²_conditional from about 0.458 to 0.654; for writing self-efficacy and writing interest, R²_marginal≈0.114 and 0.101 and R²_conditional≈0.685 and 0.625 respectively, indicating that the models, particularly when including participant-level random effects, accounted for substantial proportions of variance in these outcomes; no additional standardized effect sizes (e.g., Cohen’s d) were reported.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The discussion notes that during the CALLA-LLM intervention some students experienced frustration or confusion with GPT-4’s feedback or assigned tasks, especially when they perceived them as unclear, not directly applicable, or mismatched to their needs; these situations required rapid teacher intervention to clarify feedback, adjust tasks, and provide cognitive and emotional support. The study highlights the risk that LLM-based feedback alone may not always be immediately comprehensible or pedagogically aligned without teacher mediation; no instances of plagiarism, deliberate misuse, or ethical violations related to LLM use were reported.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "No subgroup analyses by gender, proficiency level, or other demographic characteristics were reported; authors only noted baseline homogeneity between the LLM and control groups on key variables, and there was no explicit discussion of fairness or equity implications across different learner subgroups.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Participants were drawn from a single primary/elementary school with relatively high English proficiency levels, which may limit generalizability; the study relied solely on quantitative data from writing tasks and questionnaires, without qualitative data (e.g., interviews, classroom observations) on the specific roles and interactions of teachers and LLMs; long-term sustainability of motivation, particularly writing interest, remained challenging as interest gains diminished at follow-up; and although the CALLA-LLM model improved multiple outcomes, the study did not explore in detail how individual differences in learners or contextual factors might moderate its effectiveness.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges and risks included students’ occasional frustration and confusion when GPT-4’s feedback or tasks were perceived as unclear or not directly applicable, which could disrupt engagement if not promptly addressed; the need for timely teacher intervention to provide cognitive and emotional support, clarify AI-generated feedback, and adjust tasks; the difficulty of sustaining intrinsic writing interest over time despite initial gains; and the broader challenge of ensuring that AI-driven scaffolding remains aligned with pedagogical goals and does not overshadow the development of independent SRL and writing skills.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research directions proposed include adopting mixed-methods designs to more fully explore learners’ experiences and the specific roles of LLMs and teachers in the classroom; taking a cognitive-emotional dialectical perspective to investigate how human educators and AI can collaboratively address learners’ cognitive and emotional needs; exploring how LLM-based systems can better sustain intrinsic writing motivation over time (e.g., via tailored motivational profiles or gamified elements); and examining human–AI collaboration models that optimize both strategy development and motivational support across diverse learner populations.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study implies that integrating LLMs like GPT-4 into SRL-oriented EFL writing instruction through models such as CALLA-LLM can substantially enhance students’ writing performance, SRL strategy use, and writing self-efficacy, and can provide more adaptive, personalized scaffolding than traditional teacher-only approaches; at the same time, the findings underscore that LLMs should augment rather than replace human teachers, supporting a 'Humans in the Loop' model where teachers retain a central role in orchestrating instruction, interpreting and contextualizing AI feedback, and providing the humanistic care needed to foster motivation, engagement, and deep understanding in AI-assisted language learning."
