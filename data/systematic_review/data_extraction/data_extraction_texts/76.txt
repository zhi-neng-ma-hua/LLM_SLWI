		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Compared to traditional instruction, ChatGPT-assisted instruction produced significantly higher post-test IELTS writing scores in the experimental group, with ANCOVA revealing strong effects on overall writing (partial η² = .28), task achievement (partial η² = .30), coherence and cohesion (partial η² = .27), lexical resources (partial η² = .26), and grammatical range and accuracy (partial η² = .25). Performance trajectories over six course assignments showed a clear upward trend for the experimental group, with the largest gains between weeks 6 and 10, suggesting an initial adjustment period before students could fully leverage ChatGPT. ChatGPT support particularly enhanced higher-order skills, such as argument development and coherence, by pointing out gaps, suggesting links, and providing examples and explanations, and it supported vocabulary sophistication and grammatical accuracy through contextualized feedback on word choice and collocations. Motivation outcomes showed significantly greater improvements in the experimental group, including overall motivation (partial η² = .28), writing self-efficacy (partial η² = .31), engagement (partial η² = .29), perceived value (partial η² = .27), and reduced writing anxiety (partial η² = .25). Qualitative data indicated that ChatGPT’s immediate feedback and scaffolded support transformed students’ writing mindset from task completion to iterative learning, increased time spent on revision, fostered multiple revision cycles (87% of experimental students vs 45% of controls), and created a ‘low-stakes practice environment’ that reduced anxiety and encouraged experimentation. However, effectiveness varied across individuals, depending on their ability to use prompts strategically and willingness to engage deeply with revision, and the authors highlight the need for balanced approaches that use ChatGPT as a guide rather than a crutch and promote learner autonomy."

		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "While the study reports predominantly positive impacts, it acknowledges concerns about potential over-reliance on AI-generated content and the risk that some students might treat ChatGPT as a substitute rather than a scaffold; qualitative data indicated that the effectiveness of ChatGPT was mediated by students’ ability to use it strategically and their willingness to critically evaluate suggestions, and the authors emphasize the need for balanced approaches to avoid ChatGPT becoming a ‘crutch’ that undermines independent writing and to maintain academic integrity.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "No subgroup analyses by gender, proficiency level, or other demographic variables were conducted or reported; equity-related discussions focus on providing post-study access to ChatGPT training for the control group to ensure equal educational opportunities rather than on differential effects across subgroups.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "The study notes limitations including a relatively small sample size confined to 76 first-year English majors at a single public university in Northern Vietnam, which restricts generalizability; a 15-week intervention that may not capture long-term sustainability or potential plateaus of learning gains; and lack of control for individual differences such as prior technology experience or learning styles that might influence responsiveness to ChatGPT-assisted instruction.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges and risks highlighted include the need for an adjustment period of approximately six weeks for students to learn to use ChatGPT effectively; the requirement for structured training and support to develop effective prompting and critical evaluation of AI feedback; risks of over-reliance on ChatGPT and diminished independent editing if not carefully managed; potential disparities in students’ capacity to benefit from AI due to varying digital skills and engagement with revision; and the necessity of clear guidelines, monitoring, and teacher training to integrate ChatGPT while preserving academic integrity and learner autonomy.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "The authors propose future research on longitudinal effects of ChatGPT-assisted instruction on writing skills and motivation beyond one semester, cross-cultural comparative studies of AI integration in different EFL contexts, investigations into the optimal balance between AI assistance and traditional instruction in blended learning models, and further examination of how individual learner variables such as prior technology experience and learning styles mediate the impact of AI-assisted writing.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "Theoretically, the findings extend social constructivism by illustrating how ChatGPT can act as a ‘knowledgeable other’ within an expanded Zone of Proximal Development, enrich language learning motivation theory by showing how AI-mediated feedback can initiate a self-reinforcing cycle of increased self-efficacy, reduced anxiety, and greater engagement, and refine TPACK by demonstrating the temporal development and importance of integrated technological-pedagogical-content knowledge in AI-assisted writing instruction. Practically, the study suggests that EFL programs can effectively leverage ChatGPT to enhance writing performance and motivation if they provide structured orientation, scaffolded prompting training, interaction logs and reflective tasks, and assessment designs that reward critical use of AI rather than copying; it underscores the need for teacher professional development, institutional policies and ethical guidelines on AI use, and carefully designed blended pedagogies that maintain student agency and focus on higher-order writing skills in resource-constrained and traditionally teacher-centered contexts."
