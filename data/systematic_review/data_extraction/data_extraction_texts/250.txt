	"Intervention": {
		"duration (干预时长与频率)": "Single class session of about 85 minutes including 10 minutes rule introduction, 45 minutes three round gameplay, and 30 minutes report writing, plus pre and post questionnaires administered around the session",
		"llm_model_type (LLM模型类型_如ChatGPT_GPT4_Gemini等)": "ChatGPT (GPT 3.5) powering NPC conversational agents via Poe",
		"llm_model_configuration (LLM模型配置与版本_API_网页_参数等)": "Three conversational agents were created using the Create bot function on the Poe platform with GPT 3.5 as the underlying model; system prompts specified each NPCs identity, relationship with the victim, and role in a detective story, and loaded a knowledge base of potential questions and key points generated first by ChatGPT then reviewed, selected, and edited by researchers; bots were instructed to answer only the detectives questions, to include specific key points only when asked about corresponding issues, to avoid revealing information prematurely, and to refuse and redirect irrelevant questions; prompt engineering was iterative, with repeated testing of responses and subsequent refinement, followed by pilot testing with four undergraduate students.",
		"llm_integration_mode (LLM整合模式_直接使用_教师中介_系统嵌入)": "In the experimental group, students directly interacted in real time with ChatGPT-powered NPCs through Poe on their own devices during the game, using the bots as the in-game suspects within the detective storyline; the LLM was embedded at the NPC dialog level within the storyline-driven game-based activity rather than mediated through the teacher.",
		"prompting_strategy (提示策略_提示工程与使用方式)": "Researchers crafted detailed prompts including explicit instructions about the story context, character roles, allowed and disallowed disclosures, and constraints to keep conversations on case relevant topics; input data and expected key point outputs were derived by asking ChatGPT to propose potential questions and outline responses based on the full story, then editing these to form the NPCs internal knowledge base; NPCs were further instructed to respond only to relevant detective questions, not to volunteer extra information, and to redirect off topic questions back to the investigation; the design leverages task oriented role prompting and content gating but does not report advanced user facing prompt templates for students.",
		"training_support_llm_literacy (LLM素养与提示培训)": "Before the intervention, students in the experimental group were guided to set up Poe accounts and were given tips and demonstrations on how to conduct inquiries and communicate effectively with bots to minimise confusion and provide initial scaffolding; no explicit training on critically evaluating AI output, academic integrity, or broader LLM literacy beyond these usage tips was reported.",
		"intervention_implementation (干预实施流程_步骤与任务)": "Both groups first completed a pre intervention questionnaire on demographic information and intrinsic motivation for EFL writing. During the 85 minute session, students were introduced to the detective case storyline and rules and told they would act as detectives investigating a college students death by interrogating three suspects and then writing a report. In three 15 minute rounds of gameplay, both groups experienced the same story plots and visual materials, but with different NPC interaction modes: control group students read re readable digital texts containing pre scripted dialogues between the detective and suspects with hyperlinks for navigation, while experimental group students interacted with corresponding ChatGPT-powered NPCs on Poe to obtain information. Throughout gameplay, students could take notes on clues and suspicions. After the three rounds, all students wrote a 200 word investigative report in 30 minutes explaining who they thought was responsible and justifying their conclusion with evidence from the investigation. After task completion, both groups completed a post intervention questionnaire assessing intrinsic motivation, situational interest, cognitive load, and effort regulation. Experimental group Poe chat histories with NPCs were then collected for later analysis.",
		"experimental_group_intervention (实验组干预内容)": "Storyline-driven game-based learning with the same detective narrative and visual materials as the control group, but with three suspects implemented as ChatGPT-powered NPCs that responded dynamically to students inquiries about the case; students in the experimental group were instructed in logging into Poe and chatting with the NPC bots to gather information during each of the three 15 minute investigation rounds and then produced a 200 word argumentative report on the case.",
		"control_group_intervention (对照组干预内容)": "Storyline-driven game-based learning using the same detective story plots, settings, and visual materials, but NPC dialogues were conventional and pre scripted within digital texts; students in the control group read the scripted dialogues between detective and NPCs via digital pages with hyperlinks to navigate and gather information, then wrote the same 200 word investigative report without any ChatGPT-powered interaction.",
		"writing_stage (写作阶段_如生成_修改_反馈_重写等)": "Single draft production of a 200 word argumentative investigation report after gameplay; there was no AI supported drafting, revising, or feedback on the written text itself within the study.",
		"writing_genre (写作体裁)": "Argumentative investigative report in English based on a detective story, assessed as argumentative writing with focus on argumentation quality",
		"writing_task_type (写作任务类型)": "Timed in class task to write a 200 word report in English stating the conclusion about the case, justifying that conclusion with relevant examples and evidence from the investigation, and addressing opposing viewpoints where appropriate.",
		"role_llm (LLM角色_如生成文本_给反馈_评分_对话等)": "LLM served as the dialog engine for three NPC suspects, conducting natural language conversations with students, answering questions about the case within a constrained knowledge base, providing perspectives, explanations, and reactions as suspects, and maintaining plot consistency; the LLM did not generate essays for students or perform scoring, and its pedagogical role was to enable dynamic, personalized interrogation and information gathering within the game storyline.",
		"role_instructor (教师角色与介入方式)": "The instructor designed the storyline, created and tested the ChatGPT-powered NPCs, introduced the game rules and background, scaffolded initial question asking strategies for the experimental group, ensured both groups understood the tasks, and administered questionnaires and the writing task; during gameplay, the instructor acted mainly as facilitator and monitor rather than intervening in or mediating the NPC conversations.",
		"setting (教学情境_学校类型_课程类型_线上线下)": "On campus session of an English writing course at a comprehensive university in China, delivered in a classroom setting with students using digital devices to access either digital text interfaces (control group) or Poe based ChatGPT-powered NPCs (experimental group) during a synchronous lesson.",
		"ethical_consideration (伦理审查与知情同意)": "Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the study, and students were informed of the research purpose and their rights; there is no explicit mention of formal institutional ethics committee approval, but the study states that participants were fully aware of the research and consented.",
		"llm_access_policy (LLM使用规范_允许与限制)": "Only students in the experimental group were guided to create and use Poe accounts to interact with the ChatGPT-powered NPCs during the intervention; control group students were not asked to use Poe; both groups used the same underlying story content, and there is no indication that students were allowed to use ChatGPT for writing outside the designed NPC interactions during the class session.",
		"llm_safety_guardrails (LLM安全与内容过滤设置)": "Safety and control were implemented mainly through prompt engineering, constraining NPC bots to respond only to detective questions, to disclose key information only when specific topics were raised, and to refuse and redirect off topic or irrelevant questions back to the case; bots were iteratively tested to ensure accuracy and plot consistency and were piloted with four students before the main study. The authors recommend that educators critically evaluate ChatGPT responses for potential bias and maintain transparency about data use, but no additional automated safety filters or content moderation settings beyond these instructions were reported.",
		"key_findings (主要研究发现_与LLM写作干预相关)": "Compared to conventional scripted NPCs, ChatGPT-powered NPCs in storyline-driven game-based EFL writing learning significantly increased students intrinsic motivation for writing learning (enjoyment, perceived value, and perceived autonomy) after controlling for baseline motivation, with medium to large partial eta squared values. They also significantly enhanced situational interest, with higher attention quality and exploration intention, without increasing perceived sense of challenge. On the cognitive side, the ChatGPT-powered NPC condition did not significantly change intrinsic or extraneous cognitive load but did significantly increase effort regulation, indicating greater self reported effort in the learning activity. In terms of writing outcomes, students who interacted with ChatGPT-powered NPCs produced argumentative essays with significantly higher clarity, elaboration, persuasiveness, and better addressing of opposing views, as well as higher overall argumentation quality scores, while organization, sufficiency, and relevance did not differ significantly between groups. Analysis of chat histories showed that students used a variety of conversational strategies with ChatGPT-powered NPCs, dominated by elicitation moves to gather unknown information and further details, alongside confrontation, disclosure of new evidence, bonding, clarification, and attention moves. These dialogic strategies appear to have supported deeper understanding and more sophisticated argumentation in the writing task. Overall, the integration of ChatGPT-powered NPCs improved affective engagement and writing performance without imposing additional cognitive load compared to conventional NPCs."

		"affective_aspect_focus (情感因素维度_动机_态度_焦虑_自效感等)": "Intrinsic motivation dimensions enjoyment of writing learning activities, perceived value and usefulness of writing learning for improvement, and autonomy or sense of control in writing learning; situational interest dimensions attention quality during the storyline-driven writing activity, intention to explore all clues and content, and perceived level of challenge of the activity.",
		"cognitive_aspect_measure (认知因素测量工具)": "Cognitive load measured post intervention via adapted items from the Cognitive Load Scale assessing intrinsic load related to vocabulary difficulty and content complexity and extraneous load related to the way information had to be accessed in the activity; effort regulation measured with adapted items from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire, capturing how hard students tried and how they managed their effort during the writing activity.",
		"cognitive_aspect_focus (认知因素维度_策略使用_元认知监控等)": "Intrinsic cognitive load due to complexity of suspects responses and vocabulary, extraneous cognitive load due to the mode of information seeking in the writing activity, and effort regulation focusing on the amount of effort and persistence students invested in completing the storyline-driven game-based writing learning tasks.",
		"behavioral_aspect_measure (行为因素测量工具_日志_平台日志等)": "In the experimental group, Poe chat histories with the ChatGPT-powered NPCs were collected and segmented into talk moves, then coded using an adapted framework with six themes and thirteen talk move types; frequencies of each talk move category were counted across messages.",
		"behavioral_aspect_focus (行为因素维度_使用频率_交互模式_坚持度等)": "Students behavioural engagement patterns in terms of how they questioned NPCs to elicit unknown information, requested further details, elicited attitudes and reasoning, confronted inconsistencies, disclosed new evidence, built rapport, clarified their own statements, and signalled attention; distribution of talk moves showed that elicitation moves accounted for about half of all talk moves, followed by further detail requests, attitude or opinion elicitation, reasoning questions, and smaller but meaningful numbers of confrontation, disclosure, bonding, clarification, and attention moves.",
		"other_outcomes_measure (其他结果测量工具)": "Coding and frequency analysis of six themes of conversational strategies elicitation, confrontation, disclosure, bonding, clarification, and attention and thirteen specific talk move types in a total of 1311 talk moves extracted from 1171 student messages to ChatGPT-powered NPCs; logistic regression to test whether dropout from post questionnaires or essay submission was associated with age, gender, or initial intrinsic motivation.",
		"other_outcomes_focus (其他结果维度说明)": "Characterisation of the interactive processes between students and ChatGPT-powered NPCs, showing that students adopted a range of interrogation and relational strategies when engaging with NPC suspects and that these strategies were aligned with an inquiry-based learning environment that emphasises exploring sources, gathering and analysing information, and constructing explanations; dropout analyses indicated that missing questionnaire and essay data were not systematically related to age, gender, or baseline intrinsic motivation.",
		"assessment_timepoints (评估时间点_前测_后测_延迟测等)": "Pre intervention assessment of intrinsic motivation for writing learning; immediate post intervention assessment of intrinsic motivation, situational interest, cognitive load, and effort regulation directly after the 85 minute session; argumentative report writing collected at the end of the same session; no delayed follow up assessments were conducted.",
		"primary_outcome_variables (主要结果变量_因变量)": "Post intervention intrinsic motivation enjoyment, value, autonomy; situational interest attention quality, exploration intention, sense of challenge; cognitive load intrinsic and extraneous load; effort regulation; argumentation quality dimensions organization, sufficiency, clarity, elaboration, relevance, persuasiveness, addressing opposing views; and total argumentation quality score.",
		"independent_variables_and_factors (自变量与实验因素)": "Instructional condition with two levels ChatGPT-powered NPCs versus conventional scripted NPCs in storyline-driven game-based learning, with pre intervention intrinsic motivation scores used as covariates in ANCOVA for motivation outcomes.",
		"followup_length_and_type (随访时长与类型)": "NA",
		"statistical_significance (统计显著性结果摘要)": "ANCOVA controlling for baseline intrinsic motivation revealed that the ChatGPT-powered NPC group had significantly higher post enjoyment (adjusted mean about 6.30 vs 5.48, F(1,72) = 13.981, p < .001), perceived value (about 5.94 vs 5.26, F(1,72) = 10.214, p = .002), and autonomy (about 5.93 vs 5.41, F(1,72) = 5.580, p = .021). Independent samples t tests showed higher situational interest in the experimental group for attention quality, t(72) = 2.610, p = .011, and exploration intention, t(72) = 2.380, p = .020, but no significant group difference in sense of challenge, t(72) ≈ −0.16, p ≈ .87. Cognitive load intrinsic and extraneous did not differ significantly between groups, with p values .075 and .130 respectively, whereas effort regulation was significantly higher in the ChatGPT group, t(72) = 2.237, p = .028. For writing performance, the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group on clarity, t ≈ 2.44, p = .017; elaboration, t ≈ 4.10, p < .001; persuasiveness, t ≈ 2.34, p = .022; and addressing opposing views, t ≈ 3.07, p = .003; overall argumentation quality score was also significantly higher, t(69) = 2.093, p = .040; no significant group differences were found for organization, sufficiency, or relevance.",
		"effect_size_summary (效应量摘要)": "Effects of ChatGPT-powered NPCs on intrinsic motivation were medium to large, with partial eta squared values of approximately .165 for enjoyment, .126 for perceived value, and .073 for autonomy. For situational interest, effect sizes for attention quality and exploration intention were around Cohen d = 0.55 to 0.61, indicating medium to large effects. Effort regulation also showed a medium effect size of about d = 0.52. For writing performance, effect sizes in favour of the ChatGPT group were medium to large for clarity and persuasiveness (d around 0.56 to 0.58), large for elaboration (d about 0.98), and medium to large for addressing opposing views (d about 0.72). Overall argumentation quality had a small to medium effect size of about d = 0.50.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "The study did not report cases of plagiarism, over reliance, or harmful misuse of ChatGPT-powered NPCs by students during the session; cognitive load results indicated that the ChatGPT-powered NPC condition did not increase intrinsic or extraneous cognitive load relative to the control condition. However, the authors caution that educators should critically evaluate ChatGPT outputs during bot creation to detect potential biases and ensure that NPC responses remain relevant and pedagogically appropriate, and they highlight the need for transparency about the use of ChatGPT and handling of interaction data.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "No detailed subgroup analyses by gender, discipline, or proficiency level were reported for learning outcomes; logistic regression analyses indicated that dropout from the post intervention questionnaire and essay submission was not significantly related to age, gender, or initial intrinsic motivation, suggesting that missing data were relatively random, but the authors acknowledge that the single site Chinese undergraduate sample limits generalisability.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "Main limitations include the short intervention duration of only one 85 minute class, which may not capture long term or sustained effects and may be influenced by novelty of interacting with ChatGPT-powered NPCs; focus on a single narrative type detective story about a specific case, which constrains generalisation to other story genres; use of text based interactions only, without multimodal features such as speech or video; reliance on two intact classes from a single comprehensive university in China with a limited age range, which reduces generalisability; absence of long term follow up assessments to examine retention of effects; and lack of direct measurement of some constructs from the CAMIL framework beyond the selected affective and cognitive factors.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Implementation challenges and risks discussed include the need for teachers to take on a facilitative role rather than assuming ChatGPT-powered NPCs can replace teacher expertise, the necessity of training students in advance to ask meaningful and focused questions so that interactions remain aligned with learning objectives, the requirement to monitor student NPC interactions to keep them on task, and ethical concerns around potential bias in ChatGPT generated responses and transparency about how interaction data are collected, stored, and used; the authors emphasise that educators must critically review NPC outputs during development and clearly inform students about the presence and role of ChatGPT in the learning activity.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research directions proposed include implementing ChatGPT-powered NPC based storyline-driven game-based learning over longer periods to examine lasting effects on motivation and writing performance and to control for novelty effects, exploring additional story genres and contexts to test the robustness of findings across different narratives, and incorporating multimodal generative AI such as newer multimodal GPT models and video generation tools to enable richer, multi channel interactions with NPCs and potentially more immersive learning experiences.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "Theoretically, the findings support the CAMIL framework by showing that increased immersion and interactivity through ChatGPT-powered NPCs can positively influence intrinsic motivation, situational interest, effort regulation, and ultimately writing performance in an immersive learning environment, and they illustrate how generative AI can be systematically integrated into storyline-driven game-based learning. Practically, the study provides a replicable model for designing storylines with setting, character, plot, and lesson elements and implementing NPCs as ChatGPT-powered conversational agents using Poe, suggesting that educators can adapt this design across subjects to foster critical thinking and argumentative writing; it also underscores that teachers must remain central as facilitators who prepare students to interact productively with AI, monitor and guide interactions, and attend to ethical issues such as bias and data transparency when adopting generative AI in writing instruction."
