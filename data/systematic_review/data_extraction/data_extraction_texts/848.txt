ANCOVA partial eta squared values were 0.27 for global writing performance, 0.19 for content, 0.34 for organization, 0.11 for language use, and 0.38 for writing motivation, indicating medium to large effect sizes for the impact of ChatGPT-based instruction after controlling for pre-test scores.",
		"llm_misuse_or_negative_effects (LLM滥用或负向效应)": "Interviewed students noted several potential negative effects of AI-assisted writing: some ChatGPT suggestions were not contextually accurate or did not align well with their personal writing style, requiring careful judgment about which feedback to accept; some participants reported becoming overly reliant on ChatGPT, seeking its guidance for almost every sentence, which they felt hindered their own creativity and critical thinking; there were concerns about the long-term impact and whether they could sustain improvement without AI support after the course; the discussion of limitations acknowledged the persistent challenge of preventing unintended plagiarism when using AI writing tools and emphasized the need for continued vigilance and ethical guidance despite efforts to instruct students on original content creation and academic integrity.",
		"equity_and_subgroup_effects (公平性与亚组差异)": "Participants were drawn from diverse regions of China, represented both genders, and pursued different majors, and the interview subsample included students of different genders and writing performance levels, but the study did not report any subgroup analyses by gender, major, proficiency level, or other equity-related factors; no explicit conclusions about differential effects across subgroups were presented.",
		"limitation (研究局限)": "The authors note several limitations: the sample consisted of Chinese EFL undergraduates at a single national university, which may limit generalizability to other cultural, institutional, or proficiency contexts; the sample size (N=50) is relatively small, potentially limiting statistical power and external validity; the 12-week intervention period is relatively short, so the durability of improvements in writing skills and motivation over longer periods remains unknown; there was no long-term follow-up after the post-test; potential contamination between experimental and control groups in a real educational setting could not be completely ruled out; despite guidance on ethical use, there remained a risk of unintended plagiarism due to AI-generated suggestions; and the study did not evaluate in detail the accuracy and quality of ChatGPT feedback, nor did it directly compare AI and teacher feedback effects.",
		"challenge (实施挑战与风险)": "Challenges included ensuring that ChatGPT’s feedback was contextually appropriate and aligned with students writing styles; preventing learners from becoming overly dependent on AI assistance at the expense of their own creativity and critical thinking; managing plagiarism risks when learners work with AI-generated suggestions; maintaining comparable out-of-class practice time and preventing contamination between AI-assisted and traditional classes in an authentic educational environment; and addressing students uncertainty about sustaining writing improvements once AI support is removed.",
		"future_work (未来研究方向)": "Future research should replicate and extend these findings with larger and more diverse samples across different institutions, cultural contexts, and proficiency levels; implement longer intervention periods and longitudinal follow-up assessments to examine the sustainability of AI-assisted improvements in writing skills and motivation; compare AI feedback directly with instructor feedback in terms of accuracy, relevance, and impact on performance and affect; investigate the role of AI in other writing genres such as creative and argumentative writing; explore how to balance AI guidance with learner autonomy to avoid over-reliance; refine methods to mitigate plagiarism risks and strengthen ethical AI use; and further examine how evolving AI systems can be continuously updated and adapted to meet changing learner needs while integrating effectively with established pedagogical frameworks.",
		"implication (理论与教学实践启示)": "The study suggests that integrating ChatGPT-based AI-assisted language learning into EFL writing courses can substantially enhance academic writing performance and writing motivation compared to traditional instruction, supporting the view that AI tools can function as effective virtual peers and scaffolds within a Vygotskian social constructivist framework. Practically, it implies that EFL educators should consider establishing AI-supported writing classes, training learners to use AI tools ethically and strategically, and leveraging AI for immediate, personalized feedback on language use, organization, and content while still maintaining human instructional oversight. The findings also highlight the importance of designing AI-assisted activities that foster engagement, self-regulation, and confidence, and of carefully managing potential challenges such as over-reliance, contextual inaccuracies, and academic integrity, pointing toward hybrid human–AI models that combine the strengths of both."
